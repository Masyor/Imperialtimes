    <h2 class="title--large main-title">PRICE OF COMPETENCY</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: dankest0130</em>
</br></br>As the struggle for Atoma Prime drags on, concentrated around the capital Hive of Tertium, analysts and computationaries debate on the effectiveness of Inquisitor Grendel’s strategy of deploying strike teams comprised of former penal members, dubbed Rejects. 
    
</br></br>While the effectiveness of the best Rejects, those who have reached Auric classification, cannot be denied, accomplishing virtual suicide missions against an overwhelming opposition, the price for each Auric operative comes at the cost of a mountain of bodies. For ever Auric level operative, hundreds to thousands of poorly equipped and supplied Rejects perish in the dire gauntlet to prove their worth. 

</br></br>Even for those who reach Auric level, their fates remain in constant danger, sent on even deadlier missions to maintain their place, if marginally better armed and trained. Grendel’s detractors have suggested that if the inquisitor had fully mustered the manpower of his seemingly inexhaustible supply of penal troops against the Moebian 6th, then the war for Atoma may have ended months ago. If a team of four Auric operatives can do the impossible, what could a team of eight, sixteen, or even a full platoon manage? 

</br></br>The inquisitor’s harshest critics claim his methods are eerily in line with the radical faction of the Inquisition known as the Isstvanian, who believe in strength through adversity, but to an insane extreme. Thus far, those brave enough to speak out against the inquisitor remain far from his reach and eye.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">IMPERIAL EDICT CLARIFIES 170 STEP PROCESS FOR PAPERWORK ERRORS</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: The Editor</em>
</br></br>In a monumental effort to bolster bureaucratic discipline and reaffirm the sanctity of the Imperial Administratum, the Adeptus has issued a new, comprehensive guide for rectifying even the most minor of paperwork errors. The new protocol, designated Form 42-Omega-Rho, outlines a precise, 170 step process for amending any document deemed to contain a "non-critical, yet aesthetically displeasing" error.

</br></br>This sweeping mandate, distributed via secure cogitator-link to all planetary Administratum offices, is intended to curb the rising tide of 'casual' clerical mistakes. "A single misplaced smudge or a subtly off-center stamp is not merely an error; it is an affront to the Emperor and a stain upon the efficiency of the Imperium," stated Senior Sub-Adept Thryssus Kael. "This new protocol ensures that every loyal servant understands the gravity of their task and corrects their transgressions with the reverence and process they deserve."

</br></br>The 170 step process is a masterclass in bureaucratic rigor. It begins with the offending Adept acquiring an 'Error Notification' (Form 11-Gamma), which must then be stamped by no fewer than three higher-ranking Adepts. The document then proceeds through a series of mandated re-copying, ritualistic burning of the original flawed document, and a final, ceremonial re-submission. The final step, as outlined in the decree, is for the Adept to spend one hour in silent contemplation of the "Glory of perfect administrative order."

</br></br>While some have expressed concern over the potential for increased delays, the Administratum has dismissed these fears as "heretical murmurs." They assure the populace that the new process is not about slowing down work, but about ensuring that all work is done with the flawless grace demanded by the Imperium.
