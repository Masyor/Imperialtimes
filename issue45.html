    <h2 class="title--large main-title">POWERFUL WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THE HERETICS!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: warclaimer</em>
</br></br>Yesterday observers within the Moebian 53rd have reported sights of heretics bearing what appear to be plasmaguns utilized by heretic specialists according to our boys on the front. Previously these weapons were seemingly just in the hands of trusted officers within the damned Moebian 6th such as Rodin Karnak who was killed by an Inquisitorial Strike team according to official dispatches, now however they seem to be becoming more commonplace as evidenced by these sightings. 
    
</br></br>The Inquisition would like to remind readers that this supposed “show of power” by the heretics just means that our brave guardsmen are really chipping away at the menace on Tertium, so much so they have to begin fielding more powerful weapons to even hope to stop the righteous warriors of the God Emperor. Tertium will be free and the God Emperor will shine his light to burn the filth of these heretical traitors from the hive city once and for all.

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: thefelgus</em>
</br></br>Rogue Trader Tavius von Jerrod of the esteemed von Jerrod line has begun handing out invitations to his Magnae Accessio as of recent. However, in an effort to have masses of pilgrims and other Rogue Traders present at the ceremony for discussions and agreements, he has sent out a message asking that any Imperial citizen in the Climenes Sector and Ultramar as a whole may attend. A leaked guest list has already listed several prominent men and women across the sector, from Inquisitors to even representatives of the Ultramarines Chapter in attendance.

</br></br>Security at the ceremony has reported to also be high, with reports even mentioning an ancient Terra-class Battleship belonging to Battlefleet Climenes to be among the security forces. Rogue Trader von Jerrod's own Pilgrim Guard will also be securing the planet, alongside planetary enforcers across his realm and Guardsmen regiments from Pa'tuun.

</br></br>The ceremony is expected to be held in the Capital Palace of the Shrineworld of New Congragh, the von Jerrod capital, starting with a processional of guests and their retinues alongside flyovers and artillery salutes. Many worlds across his demesne will be honoring the ceremony with live voxcasts, and all worlds will be sending portions of men to join the procession, including the fearsome Trion Void Anvils and steeled Mirehold Sappers. 

</br></br>Representatives of the Ecclesiarchy have mentioned pride at one of their brothers ascending to the mantle of Rogue Trader. Long time companion of Tavius von Jerrod, Captain of the Watch Ignatio Vorriz, expressed immense pride at the ascent of a man he considered a brother with this:

</br></br>'My lord's ascension to Rogue Trader has been, without a doubt, a defining moment in both our lives. I know his anxiety for something like this is overwhelming for him, but I can tell that behind all the pacing and prayer, he really is excited to undergo this transformation of rank."

</br></br>Journalists of the Cliemenes Post have spoken with several other potential guests, too - including Arch-Magos Physic Arthul-7 of Station Alpha-9 Trion, who had this to say:

</br></br>"Unit: Tavius von Jerrod is an exceptionally lucky and talented individual. The Omnissiah has blessed him both with an understanding heart for my brethren, and a willingness to cooperate in tough times. He has proven himself many times. This unit hopes our gift to him is suitable repayment for our debts owed."

<h2 class="title--large main-title">SIR BEATUS CHUNGISIUS POSTS NEW GUIDE FOR THE POORS TO MAKE THRONES</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: hormmy</em>
</br></br>Sir Beatus Chungisius famed economist in Subsector Yousuckia will soon publish the new book "Escaping the Peasent Mindset" for all denizens of the lower and underhives to start making proper thrones. 

</br></br>In his infinite mercy he hopes that this will lead to less commoner revolts as they learn it is purely their fault for not living a life of luxury. 

</br></br>The imperial times has published its first excerpt here. "The First thing you should understand is that you need to stop spending money on Gold Leafed Chem Laced Grox Fillet, and Bovine Juice. Lowering your diet down to only purified water and freshly baked sweet breads might be a challange but combined with giving up your lunch breaks and working 25 hours a day you should be able to save enough money to afford a 1 bed 1 shower hab. In times were you need extra food, eating one of your offspring may also provide the necessary nutrition as well as cut out another expense. 

</br></br>Truly you need to stop thinking like a peasent if you want to live like a king"

</br></br>A rise in sightings of strange ships with glowing “sails” have been reported on the southern borders of Segmentum Ultima. Merchants and pilgrims voice their concern while Navy Admirals reassure that there is no need to fear, as these archaic xeno vessels are no match for the mighty warships of the Imperium.

</br></br>Governor Scrump, of Gruna 9E03 has been found embezzling The Emperor's Thrones in an attempt to recoup costs from a new augmetic replacement program. When given the chance to peacefully surrender and become a Servitor, he began a short-lived war with his staff who had been secretly armed and trained, ending in the complete butchery of every living being in the Palace.  When contacted for an interview, the responsible party stated 'It is a good day to be a tool of the Omnissiah'
