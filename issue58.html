  <h2 class="title--large main-title">TROUT STOCKS COLLAPSE ON LAMIA PRIME</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>Two months after the collapse of Lamia Prime’s river systems. The rivers, citizens are told, are stabilizing. The fish, they are told, are safe. An Adminastratum Clerk from the Ultima Segmentum named Kestrel Rivetski conducted an independent investigation says differently. As well as a plasma reactor explosion last month saying otherwise.

</br></br>Along the Virex, Solenne, and Lower Bastion tributaries, trout have emerged altered beyond recognition. Their bodies are misshapen and thickened, scales fused into metal plate armor, the eyes have become multi-ocoulus. Some are bioluminescent at night. Folk fishermen report that the fish can speak in low gothic, however, Magos-Biologis Ichthys denies these have any real facet of reality and is likely due to the radiation sickness the population is suffering. Claiming it is delirium. Iodine tablets are being distributed by the local Orders Hospitaller who have decided to stay and pray for those loyal faithful that had resisted the traitorous rebellion a year ago and aide in its reconstruction. However, something disastrous has occurred about a month ago. A plasma reactor exploded.

</br></br>Internal documents leaked from the independent Adminastratum Clerk of the Planetary Sustenance Office however, point to the cause of the explosion. Unshielded radiation released following damage to sub-reactor cooling systems beneath Vantorus Hive during the opening hours of the uprising and was never repaired due to the fighting and even post-rebellion. According to those leaked records, emergency venting was conducted without full proper and correct containment rites before the reactor was abandoned and allowed to explode. Coolant channels have bled directly into the river system for the year unknowingly before exploding last month. Further leaks also show an Eminaticus Tech-Priest Antidrastiras attempted to conceal this information, believing he could fix the reactor without the damage being known. He was reportedly vaporized in said explosion.

</br></br>In the fallout, civilians are attempting to rebuild pump-houses, docks, and floodworks report attacks from aggressive trout. One famous holodrama fisherman named Jeremiah Wadish from the popular show River Fish was eaten by a 2 meter long trout. This is what initially prompted the investigation. Enforcers have been deployed in increasing numbers. Patrols have established cordons during daylight reconstruction efforts, directing civilians away from the water at dusk. 

</br></br>Governor-Marshal Voss’s administration continues to issue assurances that Lamia Prime’s recovery proceeds as planned. The word radiation has been redacted from all official newspapers on the planet.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title"> BREAKAWAY HUMAN WORLD RECLAIMED </h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: beardog2150</em>
</br></br>Let a thousand thousand bells ring, the world of Tanzogawa has been returned to the Emperor's light!  Once a prosperous part of the Magrath sector, Tanzogawa has regrettably been severed from the Imperium for this last handful of centuries; unfortunately, due to that circumstance, the populace grew forgetful and rebellious, committing themselves not to holding out for rescue but to true independence.  When Sector Lord Gotlinde of the neighboring Rauria Sector heard of this state of affairs, she submitted an official request for an expedition to be mounted, and Tanzogawa added to her sector - an expedition the Administratum saw fit to approve.  While the Tanzogawans could muster no effective void defense against the puissant might of the Imperial Navy, their ground defenses were more substantial, and the dozen regiments of the Imperial Guard that had been committed were vastly outnumbered by the rebel hordes.

</br></br>Thankfully, bold action by the 122nd Planetary Assault Company of the Navis Breachers prevented a lingering, destructive war, staging an orbital drop on a vital hydroelectric plant near Tanzogawa's capital!  By crippling the rebels' power supplies, the Imperial Guard could safely land on the capital's doorstep, and swiftly seize the rebel leaders and their main settlement, forcing a surrender!  When asked for comment on this heroic mission, Voidmaster Thaddeus Morgan of the 122nd stated that "the rebels fought hard, but not hard enough" and that "Emperor be praised for only 40% casualties".  As for questions about the unusual use of murder-servitors on a planetary surface, he stated that "one weapon was as good as another".  Truly no weapon is too harsh for those who would willingly blind themselves to the Emperor's light!

<p class="magazine"><strong>THE EGNIGMATIC TERRAN GROX</strong>
  
  </br></br>One of the most ancient recipes in humanity is known as the "Steak" a very simplistic meal created from an ancient Terran creature known as a Cow. While the venerable cow, for the most of the galaxy, has gone extinct with occasional exceptions where they have been seeded on worlds or maintained in personal zoos, the majority of people cannot experience the ancient Terran meal. Thus we have to substitute with the Grox the most common approximate within an imperial citizens grasp.

<ol><li>First you require a Grox Sirloin roughly an inch and a half in thickness.</li>

<li>Proceed to tenderize it mechanically with a hammer or through a wooden/metal skewer.</li>

<li>Cover in a citric acid fruit juice for 10 minutes.</li>

<li>Pad the Steak Dry with a towel.</li>

<li>In a pan, Render Grox fat from meat scraps or use pre prepared fat. Let the fat settle or heat at a warm tempature; not enough to cook, but in a liquid form.</li>

<li>With a syringe, inject said fat into the Grox Sirloin. Each injection should be half an inch away from a previous injection. Inject until the Steak is staturated.</li>

<li>In an oven set at 225 Degrees F cook for 30 minutes.</li>

<li>Remove Steak and sear with a Flamer.</li>

  <li>Let the Steak rest for 5 minutes then cut and season.</li></ol>


<p class="magazine"><strong>DREVENIAN REACH CLEANSED</strong>
  
  </br></br>Rogue Trader Tavius von Jerrod has announced that the Drevenian Reach in Segmentum Pacificus has finally been cleansed of Xenos and heretical filth. 

</br></br>Home of the honorable Rogue Trader's fiefs, the Drevenian Reach has been a warzone for several years. Between heretical cults, Tyranid fleets, and Aeldari tricksters, Tavius cleansed the Expanse's 16 systems in short order. The penultimate and glorious battle took place on the mining world of Folus, where local militia fought to destroy a heretical cult that the Rogue Trader had previously thought exterminated. Supported by the heroes of the Navis Imperialis and Astra Militarum, Folus was besieged for six months before the largest mining complex was flattened by the timely intervention of a group of His Holy Adeptus Astartes known as the Storm Wardens.

</br></br>Once the planet was cleansed, Tavius von Jerrod arranged for a celebration which took place over the course of 18 days.
