    <h2 class="title--large main-title">WAR ON BALSEMAIC DRAGS ON</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: altonascends</em>
</br></br>The World of Balsemaic was pretty once. It is no longer. It is a hellish wretch of a thing crisscrossed with trench lines. The world has been at war for 100 years now and has once more stalled out. The militarum has stated that the reason for the third overrun of this war is very simply that the current former commander (the 12th to hold this role) was somehow also a traitor plant. 
    
</br></br>It is not understood how they have managed to place 12 consecutive traitor commanders and to be blunt this writer hopes the individuals in charge of commander placement are also shot. For now the 13th overall commander has stated that it will take him at least three years to even begin to pick up operational tempo. How such incompetent fools are in charge of the emperors own army shocks and appalls me. Let us hope this commander finishes the war in a timely manner.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">BURGERTHRONE STOCKS SURGE</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: altonascends</em>
</br></br>Reports from the departmento stocktorum caused a market rally today after the highly controversial and important quarterly report of 20 years ago was found in the records for types of cheese deemed nonexistent. 

</br></br>The gene line of the clerk who made this error has of course been sentenced to servitorization for 500 years of death of gene line. The report, which showed record breaking earnings was a major indicator that the other lost reports of the last 19 years are also probably positive and therefore the company is much more valuable than before. 

</br></br>We interviewed imperial noble Karanac Flakentets who stated that the profits he would realize from this would finally allow for him to afford his 12th planet. Upon which he would build another burger emperor as they seem to be quite the profitable investment. 

</br></br>Allegations that the document was forged by inquisitor En Ron who had a massive investment in the corporation has been met with executions as at no inquisition member would ever engage in market manipulation.

<h2 class="title--large main-title">FREEZE NEARLY OVER</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: tidus1307</em>
</br></br>The grand ol’ administrative freeze on our gallant military and structural affairs is nearly over! During these months of this ironclad hold, the Imperium’s stood tall! In this time our true blue collar workers have stacked up a backlog of red-hot, must-do improvements just waiting for the green light! In strict obedience to the big freeze, not a single vote, not a solitary shake-up in the administration has taken place! Steady as she goes, but the winds of change are rattlin’ the windows!

</br></br>What’s waitin’ on the other side? Why, none other than Inquisitorial Kill Teams to keep heretics on their toes, increased supply for special weapons granted to our brave men and women of the Militarum, and even empty dreadnoughts held in reserve for the direst hour of our Angels of the Emperor! Stay tuned for important changes the freeze ends!
