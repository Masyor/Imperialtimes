</br></br>Citizens of the Imperium, rejoice! For the hour is upon us! The long night, that vile shadow which has crept across the stars, trembles! Trembles for Mankind does not cower. Mankind does not flee. Mankind conquers!

</br></br>Today, I tell you the truth! A great host, our finest, our most loyal, our most unyielding has broken through the veil! Led by Inquisitor [REDACTED], they have pierced the cursed tides of the Eye of Terror! Not to hold the line. Not to resist. No! They enter! They strike! Into the abyss itself, a full scale offensive! The Emperor's vengeance now walks among the most corrupted stars!

</br></br>Look! See them now! The Fists of Dorn, building bastions upon the brink of madness! The Sons of Fenris, drenched in the blood of daemons! The Scions of the Schola, striking from the sky like bolts of divine wrath! The Knight Freeblades, those towering saints of steel, grinding heresy beneath iron feet!

</br></br>And the Guard. Ah, the Guard! Our glorious Astra Militarum! By the millions they march! With lasgun and faith, with banners held high! Each step, a hymn. Each volley, a prayer! They are the Emperor‚Äôs hammer, the soul of the Imperium. Of every man, woman, and child!

</br></br>This is not a battle of survival. No! This is a holy war! A war of purity! A war of righteous justice! A war of vengeance! Ten thousand years in the making!

</br></br>Citizens: Pray, yes, pray! But do not kneel in fear! Kneel in praise! For the eye has blinked, and Mankind did not flinch!

</br></br>Ave Imperator!
</br>Glory to the Golden Throne!

</br></br>STEEL ARMAGEDDON STANDS FIRM: HEROIC LAST STAND OF THE 5TH REGIMENT

</br></br>ASH-WASTES OF VORAX PRIME ‚Äì In the scorched remains of Manufactorum Grid 14-Omega, the Steel Armageddon 5th Armoured Regiment made its final‚Äîand finest‚Äîstand against the heretic tide.

</br></br>Surrounded. Outgunned. Outnumbered more than seventy to one.

</br>And they didn‚Äôt give an inch.
</br></br>---

</br></br>üî± THE FORTRESS THAT ROLLED

</br></br>At the heart of the 5th‚Äôs stand was the Baneblade ‚ÄúDivine Retribution‚Äù, a towering icon of Imperial might and holy firepower. Commanded by Colonel Helbrecht Varn, the vehicle became the anvil upon which the traitors were broken.

</br></br>Over seventeen hours of non-stop combat, the 5th Regiment held off waves of Chaos forces, including two corrupted Knight engines, dozens of traitor tanks, and a horde of warp-maddened infantry. The Baneblade fired its main cannon 54 times, annihilating five enemy armor elements and erasing entire formations in incandescent fury.

</br></br>When ammunition ran dry, ‚ÄúDivine Retribution‚Äù didn‚Äôt stop. It rammed. It crushed. It roared.

</br></br>---

</br></br>‚öôÔ∏è STRENGTH OF STEEL. WILL OF MEN.

</br></br>The last known vox-recording from Colonel Varn has already been adopted as a rallying cry across Steel Armageddon command units:

</br></br>> ‚ÄúWe are the 5th Regiment. We do not yield. We do not rust. We bring the Emperor‚Äôs wrath in treads and steel. Let them come. Let them break. FOR ARMAGEDDON! FOR THE EMPEROR!‚Äù

</br></br>Shortly after, all vox signals ceased amid the sounds of cannon fire and screaming machine spirits.

</br></br>---

</br></br>üõ°Ô∏è GLORY IN ASHES

</br></br>When Imperial forces retook the sector 29 hours later, all that remained of the 5th was wreckage, fused steel, and legends. The ‚ÄúDivine Retribution‚Äù, scorched and silent, still stood upright. Its hull was cracked. Its guns slagged. But it had not fallen.

</br></br>Inside, Colonel Varn and his crew were found at their stations‚Äîhelmets donned, hands on controls, faith unbroken.

</br></br>The Steel Armageddon 5th Regiment is gone. But their legacy is not.


</br></br>---

</br></br>‚öîÔ∏è HONOR ETERNAL

</br></br>In recognition of their sacrifice, Segmentum Command has awarded the 5th:

</br></br>The Iron Skull of Valour

</br></br>The Triple Aquila of Armageddon

</br></br>A personal commendation from Lord Commander Roboute Guilliman


</br></br>The remains of the Baneblade will be recovered and enshrined within the Fortress-Monastery of Steel Tempest on Armageddon itself.


</br></br>---

</br></br>**They held. They fought. They did not yield.
The Emperor knows their names. Let none forget.**

      <h5>Administratum Updates</h5>
<p class="magazine">Colonel Pippa Therenhawk has been voted Miss Kenesia today in a beauty pagent hosted by charitable figures. The elegant ballgown and long twin-tails tipped with a burned orange fired the blood and fervor of many an onlooker. Voluntary recruitment to the 8th Superheavy Tank Regiment has increased by 2.6% in the wake of this victory.  
<p class="magazine">The Pretty Porcupine, a custom vehicle made during Waaagh Grax and Waaagh Rarguts, is slated to be decommissioned later this week. A uniquely focused machine, it was a transport with high frequency spikes to prevent Ork borders from leaping aboard while it trundled it's cargo to the destination. The eight hundred and seventeen Ork kill count will be transferred to the data looms for posterity as this venerable workhorse retires to serve in different fields
<p class="magazine"> The Adeptus Astartes, Angels of The Emperor, have redefined the concept of renown by altering several of the recognised deeds one can complete to earn it.
  <p class="magazine"> Long denied this most basic of rights by their Lachrimallus overlords, servitors are now able to hover. Praise be to the Omnissiah!
<p class="magazine"> A recent call for aid by Lord Helmfried Vortigen III has mostly gone unanswered. He seeks "true knights" to slay what he claims to be "real dragons, yes like the ones from old Terran stories. Fire breathing and everything" that  have taken up residence in his family vault.
