    <h2 class="title--large main-title">SIEGE OF WIEDEN LIFTED!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: argo_1278</em>
</br></br>The city of Wieden on the world of Ister II, from where vehicle crews and maintenance corps flow out towards the many battlefields of the Imperium to maintain its war machines, has been lifted! Previously besieged by Chaos forces including massive, incomprehensible war machines. This victory was made possible through the prodigious efforts of the Imperial Guard, the Iron Judges Chapter of the Adeptus Astartes, a lance of Imperial Knights under the Freeblade Guerrier Kad, and the two Titans of Princeps Cuon Verdane and Nelson Almerax.

</br></br>With the regional captial of Wieden secured, the fight for Ister II swings further in the Imperium's favor, hopefully securing future supplies of crewmen and support staff for the war machines of the Imperium.

</br></br>Imperial Citizens reading this article are allowed thirty seconds to bask in the reflected glory of this victory and to sing the Chorus of Victory with the intention to have more victories follow in the wake of this one.

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: harrydugg</em>
</br></br>Citizens of the Imperium rejoice as more Questoris imperialis-aligned Knight Houses begin fully integrating into the broader structure of the Imperium of Man.

</br></br>Many worlds once considered semi-autonomous are now signing comprehensive treaties, drawing them fully into the Emperorâ€™s light. Permanent Ecclesiarchy missions and various Adeptus Administratum departments are being established on these newly aligned Throne Worlds, with some even hosting large detachments of the Astra Militarum. In a number of cases, local governments are abandoning their archaic and barbaric legal systems in favour of the refined, righteous laws of the Imperium.

</br></br>It is rumoured that Lord Regent Roboute Guilliman himself is spearheading this noble effort. Any claims suggesting coercion through planetary invasion, political manipulation, or trade embargoes are clearly heretical and should be reported to your nearest Commissar immediately.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">THE TEMPLARS RETURN TO ARMAGEDDON!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: warclaimer</em>
</br></br>Armageddon, the beloved homeworld of the galaxy famous Armageddon Steel Legion, has seen much conflict in recent years and predictions say that there is likely more to come, with several [REDACTED] forces present on the planet a myriad of Imperial Guard, Astartes, and many more have been directed or willing go to Armageddon to strengthen the defense on the planet. Thanks to informants and observers part of the Black Templars' Eternal Crusade fleet we have been given priviliged information that the Black Templars are in fact returning to Armageddon to face the threat that threatens this world once again. Among these is said to be arguably one of the most famous of the Black Templars, Reclusiarch Merek Grimaldus. 

</br></br>Readers will remember our widely publicized tale of the "Hero of Helsreach" and his heroic stand to defend the hive city Helsreach from the Ork invasion during the Second War for Armageddon. With him returning to the planet wherein he obtained his legendary status there is no doubt that this spells doom for the vile enemies of man who dare try to take Armageddon from the Imperium even after several failed attempts. We will continue to update you as the situation develops.
