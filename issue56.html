      <em>From: someguui</em>
</br></br>After the Festivities of Sanguinala, Tragedy struck within the Imperial Times Office when an Eversor of the Officio Assassinorum was released within the offices particularly on the floor reporting on Calixis Sector. The Eversor was released and active for 37 Terran Hours and Allegedly was Screaming "YOU ARE FAKE NEWS" until a second Eversor assassin was released to eliminate the first. While the First Assassin was eliminated and the second recalled promptly a large section of the Imperial Times staff had been butchered.

</br></br>The Grand Provost Marshal has ordered an investigation on the matter and has determined that the First Eversor was smuggled in by the aide of an insider within the Imperial Times however due to the secrecy of the Officio Assassinorum the investigation has come to a administrative halt. The Imperial Times would like to issue an apology to all its readers within or interested in the Calixis Sector as we experience difficulties reporting on the sector.

    </br></br>  <em>From: .angrytech</em>
</br></br>The Calixis Sector Branch of the Imperial Times was closed for a few hours earlier today, when a homeless man wearing a skull mask managed to break into the offices screaming "WRYYYYYYYYYYYYY FAKENEWS WRYYYYYYYYYYYY" and brandishing a glove that he had haphazardly glued table cutlery onto the fingers of. He was swiftly subdued by an intern wielding a caf-pot, and then restrained with spare cabling from the IT department until the Adeptus Arbites could respond to the incident. 

</br></br>Allegations about an Eversor Assassin appear to have been drummed up by our competitors in the neighboring branch of the Imperium Times, who may also have paid the homeless man to break in in the first place. 

</br></br>Rest assured, dear readers, our reporting of the Calixis Sector will continue unabated, and we will be responding to our 'respected' competitor's efforts with the derision it deserves!

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">JIMMY FALCON LIVES</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: altonascends</em>
</br></br>That’s right ladies and gentlemen, your favorite news anchor has returned from his Inquisitorial investigation with a spotless record. 

</br></br>Despite being an active high mind, yours truly Jimmy Falcon is still allowed. Now it seems like my office has been torn up by a random interior decorator who seems to have an excessive taste in blood and other folks entrails. However, this does not matter, as I am once again back to bring you the happy news! 

</br></br>Another warfront has kicked off, and our brave boys in the guard are putting in time to show the orcs that you don’t mess with the Imperium of Man. The utterly stupid foes have only made land fall by sheer weight of attempts to the point that even the Adeptus Mechanicus nearly ran out of ammunition, leading to the cease of fire from some batteries. Wisely the Magi have drawn them into the planet in specific zones, to be mopped up by a cordinated effort of three minds. The Lord General and the leader of the famed Cirrus Expeditionary Force, Hazel Kyser, The Lord Herakon of the House of Solon, and the Magos Dominus Kravanius. 

</br></br>Along with this two God Machines walk upon this world as a chance to stretch their legs. Signs say that this should be a nice short war of hatred to get a little rust off as the Indomitus Crusade goes on.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">FOOD DELIVERIES RESUME AFTER LONG MONTHS OF RATIONING</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>For the first time in 11 months, the markets of Lamia Prime have seen food again. Actual food. At first bell this cycle, bulk landers from Agri-World Ceres-Delta broke atmosphere under full escort, their holds heavy with grain, root-vegetables and vat-grown proteins. The Departmento Munitorum confirmed that forced rationing, enacted during the height of the supply interdiction, has been formally lifted for all non-frontline districts. Standard starch blocks and nutrient pastes will remain in reserve, but food allocations will now be distributed weekly through sanctioned channels with minor Hospitaller Orders being involved to aide this. And the first Militant Orders have also arrived to lay waste to the heretics that caused this rebellion. Administratum pict-feeds captured scenes of families standing patiently in the cold, children staring at crates of produce as if they were a great relic. Morale has never been higher. As the issue of malnutrition is being slowly fixed, an increase in PDF numbers shows well for the war effort.

</br></br>In related developments, officials confirm that approximately half of Lamia Prime remains stable and compliant, maintaining sufficient output to meet its Imperial Tithe even amid open rebellion. The planet’s role as a supply hub endures, continuing to provide provisions to the greater frontline against the Dominate. Additional Imperial Guard regiments are en route, tasked with crushing remaining resistance so that loyal sectors are no longer strained in their sacred obligations.

</br></br>The Emperor Protects.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">A NEW MONSTER IN SAIKYO: BRAVERY BEYOND SCALE</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: advictorian6505</em>
</br></br>We in The Imperial Times have received a teaser of the highly anticipated holodrama “Destroy All Monsters”, in which the city of Saikyo is attacked by massive xenos taller than any God-Machine, forcing a scrappy force of all parts of our noble Imperium to make battle in a devastating conflict at every turn: Against this monster, a large Grox-like figure, stand the Knights of Ferrus Ursus, armored adepts of all-important Mechanicus, valiant Guardsmen manning imposing Chimeras and Leman Russes, and no less importantly, a team of the Ultramarines, heroic Angels of Death and sons of the Primarch and Avenging Son Roboute Guilliman. 

</br></br>These heroic men, women and Angels have to combat not only the armored beast but a planetary Governor who has forgotten his vows to the Imperium and the Golden Throne, willing to sacrifice lives loyal to Him-on-Terra and manufactorums that fuel our Imperium to protect his extravagance! Will they be able to save the city, and what cost is too much to protect it? Learn more in this interview with holodrama director Akira Hondaicus!

<p class="magazine"><strong>CONTEST RESULTS RELEASED AMID SMOKING RUINS: WAS THE BLOODSHED WORTH IT?</strong>
  
  </br></br>Following weeks of administrative paralysis, the intervention of "efficiency consultants," and three months of bloody street-to-street fighting in the Archival District, the Archival Adjudication Subcommittee (AASS-SC) has finally released the winner of the Most Morbid and Prophetically Grimdark Deployment Document contest.

  </br></br>However, as the smoke clears from the barricades and the tally of casualties reaches the tens of thousands, a hushed question echoes through the hab-blocks: Was it worth it? While the winning documents were of undispitably high quality, critics point out that the riots destroyed three major ration-processing plants and the very archive meant to store the documents. The High Provost has declared the event a "resounding success for Imperial morale," though he issued this statement from an armored bunker.

  </br></br>The winning documents are available for viewing, though citizens are reminded that weeping in public remains a finable offense.
