  <h2 class="title--large main-title">TROUT STOCKS COLLAPSE ON LAMIA PRIME</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>The damage has spread downstream, metaphorically and literally. With manufactoria silent or burning, Lamia Prime’s river networks have become an unintended casualty of the uprising. Over the past cycle, local agri-reeves and hydro-cartel monitors report a sharp and accelerating collapse in native trout populations across the Lamian basin, particularly along the Virex, Solenne, and Lower Bastion tributaries.

</br></br>Under ordinary conditions, the planet’s trout stocks are modest, but locally are a prized protein for lower-hive markets, ration supplements for enforcer precincts, and a stabilizing resource for riverbound townships that have endured shortages before and survived by fishing. Usually the Lamian trout breeds faster than they can be fished, however, recent events have changed that and made a majority of the fish unsafe to eat and sterile.

</br></br>Sabotage to filtration plants and pumping stations have allowed untreated runoff from Vantorus and Tymbra Hives to spill directly into the waterways. Chemical tailings, coolant effluent, and ash from manufactorum fires drift downstream. Many trout have been found floating belly-up against lock-gates and bridge pylons, their silver bodies dulled and blistered. In some stretches, the rivers no longer move with life at all.

</br></br>The Magos-Biologis Ichthys who specializes in aquatic animals, confirmed that spawning beds have been fouled by heat discharge and particulate slag. Even where adult trout survive, eggs are failing in vast numbers. The social effects have been immediate. River markets in the southern plains have closed entirely. What fish remain are hoarded or traded at exorbitant prices, often under enforcer guard. Reports of skirmishes over netting rights and dock access are increasing, particularly as displaced hive-workers flee toward the waterways in search of food.

</br></br>Governor-Marshal Voss’s administration has issued no formal statement regarding the rivers.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">FAMINE ON FOOTFALL, UPDATE #2!!!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: .angrytech</em>
</br></br>Rejoice, dear readers, for Footfall's salvation is at hand!!

</br></br>At long last, the warp storms that make up the infamous Maw have settled enough for assistance from the Calixis sector to brave the treacherous warpways. A small flotilla lead by Noble House Carolingian and comprised of elements of Battlegroup Bystrax, the Light Combat Flotilla, and the lesser House Cantarini have responded to the call of the faithful, and set off on a search and rescue mission for the missing convoy. The representative from House Carolingian assures us that, with the decisive and skilled Lord Charles at the helm of this expedition, success is already a given!! We thank Lord Charles for his generous assistance in assembling the task force and responding so quickly to Footfall's faithful.

</br></br>Our investigative team on Footfall report that moral aboard the station is already rising, with the administration assuring the populace that, between the inevitable success of the Rescue Force and the reestablishment of travel between Footfall and Port Wander, the provision shortages will be alleviated posthast.

</br></br>As always, dear readers, we will keep you abreast of any and all changes to the ongoing situation!

</br></br><em>Editor's Note: This edition of Famine on Footfall has been subsidized, along with the cost of repairing our Calixis Branch office after an unfortunate fire that is still under investigation, through the generous donations of House Carolingian.</em>

    <h2 class="title--large main-title"> THE TREACHEROUS, GRAND ADEPTUS MECHANICUS SCHEME. </h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: blackmako. AKA: Gregory Tylis Grendor - The Imperial Truthsayer</em>
</br></br>JUDGE MORTIUS PLEASE take action against the Grand Adeptus Mechanicus Menace! It threatens the very good nature and prosperity of HIS Imperium. MAGOS NAVRATIL has been injecting Micro Servitors into the local food and water - it is making people more susceptible to Mechanicus Propaganda! This CANNOT STAND, they are no longer buying local products, but buying Mechanicus products. They cite how "good" the corpse starche is, how "durable" the clothing is, and how the new Manufactorum has provided more JOBS. Not only is it making consumers more susceptible to inferior products from out-of-world Manufactorums, but it is making them susceptible to the MECHANICUS MIND VIRUS. 

</br></br>Recently, Imperial Artists have been depicting the Tech Priests in a flattering way which is not based in reality. It does not accurately portray their hideous, malformed and augmented bodies. They are not pretty, they look like SERVITORS, because they ARE SERVITORS... Ask yourself, Servitors can't think, so who's controlling them?!? Xenos! Which XENO SPECIES wants to convince mankind that they are beautiful, superior, and better in every way? The HIDEOUS ELDAR! 
(This is not true, MANKIND IS ACTUALLY THE DOMINATE SPECIES. Guard yourself against XENOS LIES and HERESY.) [APPROVED FACTUAL STATEMENT VERIFIED BY LOCAL ORDINATE] 

</br></br>Eldar Infiltrator Teams attempt to inject themselves into society. They often times have multiple arms, are exceptionally pale and try to convince you that they are human. We all know this isn't true, and the arrival of the Mechanicus coincides with the arrival of the ELDAR INFILTRATOR TEAMS. Some witnesses report these ELDAR INFILTRATORS possess a disturbing familiarity with local LEADERS and are encouraging UNIONIZATION! Ask yourself, what else is bald and jarring looking, but tries to convince that it's one of you? THE LOCAL ENGINSEERS AND TECH PRIESTS, and disturbingly enough, they all look the same and talk the same just like Eldar Infiltrators!

</br></br>This is not the only disturbing fact, but they are using SERVITORS to conduct surveillance on Imperial Citizens. THIS. CANNOT. STAND. The Imperium CLEARLY dictates that XENOS have NO RIGHT to be on OUR PLANET. They should be immediately purged from this world! They are propagating TAX EVASION, TITHE THEFT, and IGNORANCE. JUDGE MORTIUS, please consider the sake of our children - YOU MUST TAKE ACTION. Eldar Infiltrator Teams are replacing our friends and family as we speak. In addition, they are working with the Mechanicus Menace! The Mechanicus are using micro servitors for subliminal messaging, they are conditioning the next generation to desire augmetics to be closer to their "OMNISSIAH," and they are normalizing multiple-armed, bald, ugly, and pale freaks.

<h2 class="title--large main-title">NO DATASLATES? NO CENSUS</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: The Editor</em>
</br></br>The decennial population census for the Lower Hives has ground to a halt following a "circular logic event" within the Department of Records and Redundancy.

</br></br>The crisis began when the Office of Stationery Requisition requested three hundred fresh dataslates to record the census. However, the Sub-Committee for Resource Allocation denied the request, citing a lack of documented proof of need. When the Office of Stationery attempted to file the proof, they were informed that all "Proof of Need" declarations must be submitted on a Form 7-B, which can only be correctly generated by, and stored upon, a fresh data-slate.

</br></br>As of this morning, three hundred junior scribes have been observed staring blankly at their empty ink-wells, trapped in a meditative trance of pure administration. The Department Head has issued a statement assuring the public that the census will be completed "eventually," once the population figures of all four billion citizens have been carved into the walls of the Sub-Level 4 corridor.

</br></br>Citizens are reminded that being uncounted is technically a form of tax evasion, punishable by immediate conscription into a penal legion.

      <h5>Administratum Updates</h5>
<p class="magazine"><strong>WOOD YOU BELIEVE IT?</strong>
  
  </br></br>Early battlefield reports have indicated that Balsa Prime, the planet known throughout the system to produce high-quality cuts of timber, has been completely incinerated by the 13th Brimlock Dragoons. Their usage of the Hellhound and Devildog variants of the ever-popular Chimera Personnel Carrier, arranged in the aptly-named “Desolation Squadrons,” has brought a swift end to a group of blasphemous insurrectionists. While it is certainly a tragedy that Balsa Prime's entire supply of lumber and wood derived products has been destroyed in the process of quelling the rebellion, the reader can rest easy knowing that all seven of the rebels have been brought to justice.


<p class="magazine"><strong>FAMINE ON FOOTFALL, UPDATE #3??? ( OPINION PIECE)</strong>
  
  </br></br>Dark Times Fall upon Footfall as within the depths of Footfall a Curse of Unbelief stirs within its depths. A powerful curse and plague striking at the soul and deceased puppeteering their corpses from the grave to spread their Curse of Unbelief to the faithful. Worse yet the entirety of the Corpse Starch Guilds yields are tainted as hundreds have turned after a recent delivery of corpse starch.  The Lower halls of footfall is embroiled in warfare as gangs combat roaming packs of freshly risen corpses alongside the typical gang warfare between the factions of footfall.

  </br></br>Beyond footfall in the boneyards where filth and waste of the station lies a massive undead army stirs. Thousands possibly millions of undead from a millennia of mass graves and hidden murder victims awaken to ravage the Station that had discarded them so. Only the void separates them and the Footfalls. A Calamity in waiting

<p class="magazine"><strong>LETTER TO THE EDITOR, RE: THE BALSA PRIME "INCIDENT"</strong>

</br></br>To the Esteemed Editor,

</br></br>I am writing to express my mild professional frustration regarding the recent events on Balsa Prime. While I applaud the 13th Dragoons for their zeal in eliminating those seven treacherous souls, I must point out that I had a standing order for three tons of Grade-A heartwood to finish a set of pews for the local Cathedral.

</br></br>My workshop is now filled with nothing but sawdust and disappointment. Am I truly expected to craft sacred seating out of recycled plas-crete? It’s hard to feel the Emperor’s light through a cold, grey slab of industrial runoff.

</br></br>Master Joiner Thaddeus Knot

</br></br><em>Editor's Note: Citizen Knot has been redirected to the local Arbites station to discuss whether his preference for "comfortable seating" constitutes a lack of faith in the Emperor's ability to provide for the righteous. We wish him a speedy interrogation.</em>
