<h2 class="title--large main-title">FAMINE ON FOOTFALL!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: .angrytech</em>
</br></br>For the fifth day in a row all trade and traffic to and from the spaceport of Footfall, crown jewel of the Calixis Sector, has been frozen as riots continue within the walls of the notoriously independent trading site. 

</br></br>Accounts have varied as to the cause of the riots; hab and dockworkers, and lower class menials making up the bulk of the rioters claim food shortages and unpaid wages forced on them by administrative clerks, while the station's current management places the blame on 'recidivists and insurrectional elements' taking advantage of a delay in Footfall's latest provisions shipment to try and destabilize the fragile balance of power on the station. 

</br></br>Meanwhile, the local Arbites presence has promised a swift and brutal crackdown and the eventual prosecution of the ringleaders involved - though they seem disinclined to venture further than the main promenades and upper tiers of Footfall - while various major and minor Rogue Trader Houses have begun to jockey for political advantage with various promises to supply the missing and much-needed provisions.

</br></br>In the meantime the Imperial Navy and several other Rogue Trader Houses have sent ships to follow the last known navigational route of the provisional convoy, hoping to determine their status and escort them safely to their destination. 

</br></br>We shall keep you, informed readers, apprised of the situation as it unfolds. 

</br></br>The Emperor protects.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">SPOTLIGHT ON HEMPHIA</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: dankest0130</em>
</br></br>In this edition of the Imperial’s Travel Guide to the Imperium, we celebrate the Hive World of Hemphia, situated in the Ultima Segmentum, bordering the Eastern Fringes. As the crown jewel of its namesake, the Hemphia sector, the capital of this stretch of space is blessed with a wealth of natural resources. Once vibrant plains, towering peaks, and rolling oceans have given way to the ever-growing prosperity of Mankind, the world’s natural beauty reshaped in the image of efficiency, growth, and production.

</br></br>Hemphia is covered in great hive cities and divided into eight sectors, one for every sub-quadrant of the planet. Each one is home to the greatest examples of Imperial civilization. Any hive world would be blessed if its capital were as prosperous and great as any of Hemphia's sub-quadrant capital cities or even its lesser, relatively, hive cities. For within the sector capital’s hives lies the true wealth of the world. Hemphia is home to hundreds of billions of loyal souls, boosting a population that is only rivaled by that of Holy Terra itself. With a population so numerous, records are inevitably spotty, and Hemphia’s total population may surpass even the Throne World.

</br></br>As the sector capital, Hemphia is a renowned commercial hub, where any loyal soul of the Imperium can find whatever it is their heart’s desire, where mortal materialistic desires can be fulfilled. But to feed its vast number of people, Hemphia must import food from the world of a dozen neighboring sectors. One can find all manner of exotic delicacies from Armageddon Ale, Catachan Devil steaks, and even wild boar from the recovering world of Cerinax. The masses enjoy every known flavor of corpse starch.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">UPDATE: LAMIA PRIME</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>Over the last two planetary solar cycles, Lamia Prime’s unrest has deepened into a full revolt. Vantorus Hive is now effectively lost, having become an urban Hel with few loyalist holdouts existing anymore. It has been confirmed the Archenemy has landed. Traitor apparitions mocking the Emperor’s Angels have also been sighted with deep blue armor. Tymbra Hive fares little better, its transit ring lies shattered, severed by demolition charges from unknown forces.

</br></br>Governor-Marshal Elena Voss has not addressed the sector since her initial proclamation. The Bastionis Plateau remains sealed, its void shields still up. Unconfirmed reports speak of the Household Guard being redeployed inward, abandoning outer districts to Enforcer command. Those Enforcers, in turn, are stretched thin.

</br></br>Production has ground to a halt across most primary manufactoria. Bulk ration plants have been overrun or burned, their stores either seized by the traitors or lost to fires that still smolder along the reactor plain. Orbital traffic has slowed to a crawl. Two guild freighters broke orbit without clearance after docking riots spilled onto the upper spires. Another was impounded when its captain attempted to bribe port security for immediate departure. The Lamian Trade Guilds’ earlier calls for patience have turned unpopular. Independent investigators warn that continued delays will render several Houses financially nonviable.

</br></br>Across the Orpheonic Reach, the consequences are already felt. Forward depots report ration reductions enacted ahead of schedule. Maintenance crews cannibalize idle machines for parts that once arrived weekly from Lamia Prime. Astra Militarum regiments are postponing offensives, not for lack of courage, but due to lack of supply.

</br></br>Due to the strategic value of this system, Segmentum Command is in the progress of gathering a mighty host to launch a crusade to retake the system from the Archenemy’s grasps!

</br></br>The Emperor Protects!

      <h5>Administratum Updates</h5>
<p class="magazine"><strong>FAMINE FAKE NEWS (Opinion Piece)</strong>
  
  </br></br>News of Famine , Food Shortfalls and supply disruptions is fake news. Liars and xenos agents not worth any credibility that should be locked up and shot by commissars. Fake News i tell you. If you have been to the adminastatum like i have you would of seen the massive supply of grain and grox we have in the imperium. If you hear any slander towards the Lord Regent Robute Guilliman's ability to manage the imperium then that is absolute hersey. To affirm there is a shortage of food is to admit there is a shortage of capability of the avenging son and that is heresey. It is your lack of faith that fails your body not the lack of nutrition. Thus bolster your faith and the emperor shall reciprocate for he protects.


<p class="magazine"><strong>COMMUNITY NOTICE: RATION PACK TASTE-PROFILE UPDATE</strong>
  
  </br></br>Citizens are reminded that the recent change in flavor for the "Standard Pattern Meat-Substitute Ration (Type-IV)" is not a sign of spoilage, but a deliberate nutritional adjustment. The new formula contains 4% more processed nutrient-paste and is scientifically formulated to minimise unauthorized enjoyment, thereby increasing focus on duty. Any citizen reporting a "metallic" aftertaste is encouraged to report to their local medicae for a mandatory tongue-scraping.

<p class="magazine"><strong>PSYKERS: A REMINDER</strong>
  
  </br></br>The Adeptus Arbites wishes to remind the populace that "feeling a tingle in the back of your skull" or "seeing eyes in the shadows" is not a medical condition. It is your civic duty to report such symptoms in yourself or your neighbors immediately. Failure to report psychic awakening is a Class-1 Felony.
