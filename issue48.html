    <h2 class="title--large main-title">FIRST STRIKE OF THE EXPEDITION</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>First blood of the Baritone Expedition goes to Taskforce Cerebrus!

</br></br>In a stunning display of coordination and valor, the Imperial Navy struck deep into the uncharted reaches of the Vinta Subsector, emerging victorious in what is now being hailed as the first engagement of the Baritone Crusade. The fleet’s warp jump into a region known by voidfarers as “The Circuit”, is a graveyard of long-lost Imperial expeditions. Marks of the former braves that previously tried to reclaim this forsaken corner of the galaxy for the Emperor.

</br></br>Upon translation from the warp, Taskforce Cerebrus discovered that many of the hulks drifting within the Circuit were once proud Imperial vessels, now corrupted and repurposed by the abominable intelligences. 

</br></br>Reports from the fleet confirm that within days of arrival as Imperial Forces were studying what happened to their predecessors, an enemy force launched a sudden assault, their corrupted ship emerging, falsely claiming that this subsector belonged to their foul mimicry of Man. In a fierce exchange of macro-fire and torpedo volleys, and laser batteries, the corrupted fleet was forced into full retreat.

</br></br>Miraculously, no Imperial vessels were lost in the engagement. A true show of skill of Imperial gunnery and the Emperor’s guiding hand. Stay reading on what else will occur in the Baritone Expedition as more information comes into the light. And for the holdouts in the Vinta subsector that somehow have access to the Imperial Times, Imperial reinforcements are coming. 

</br></br>It may take months, but hold steady against the xenos and abominable intelligence. In times like this, heroes are forged. Become the Emperor’s wrath against the darkness and scatter His enemies! Reinforcements are coming, have faith.

</br></br>The Emperor Protects!

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">CADIANS ARRIVE IN THE SABBAT WORLDS!</h2>

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: .angrytech</em>
</br></br>Fresh from the battlefields of Segmentum Obscurus, the Cadian 777th have thundered into the fires of war once more! We sat down for an exclusive interview with the regiment's Colonel en route to their next warzone, eager to hear from a hardened warrior what fighting against the Great Enemy was like. 

</br></br>We have included the raw transcript below, as our reporter has yet to return from his journey and sent his servo-skull ahead to ensure timely publication; that's just the sort of dedication we expect for the satisfaction of you, our readers!!

</br></br>Francis: "Could you state your name and command, for the record?"

</br></br>Colonel Anastasia Farragut: "Colonel Anastasia Farragut, of the Cadian 777th Superheavy Assault Regiment."

</br></br>F: "Thank you Colonel. Now, what does a superheavy assault regiment do exactly?"

</br></br>C: "What it says on the tin, generally. When a weakness is detected in a defensive line, or once a target has been softened by allied artillery, we're sent in to take the target by force."

</br></br>F: "So you're a regiment designed to attack more than defend? How do you handle something like the dreaded Traitor Astartes?"

</br></br>C: "That is correct. And the same way we do anyone else stupid enough to hold a line against our forces; with training and courage. I've found few things, Astartes included, willing to face a pair of Vulcan Mega-Bolters and a company of the finest melee fighters Cadia has ever produced."

</br></br>F: "Were you effective on Cadia, then?"

</br></br>[There is a noticeable pause in the transcript]

</br></br>C: "...I'm sorry, I must have misheard you. Can you repeat that?"

</br></br>F: "As a regiment meant to attack more than defend, were you less effective than you should have been on Cadia? You did serve there, yes?"

</br></br>C: "...We did. And there were more than sufficient opportunities to perform offensive actions trying to save our world."

</br></br>F: "Would you say, though, that you were not as effective as other forces more suitable for such general defensive actions? Do you believe the Departmento Munitorum made a mistake in the units it sent to defend Cadia?"

</br></br>[There is another noticeable pause in the transcript, the servo-skull picking up the sound of several metallic clicks]

</br></br>C: "What, exactly, are you implying?"

</br></br>F: "Is the fall of Cadia and the splitting of the God-Emperor's holy Imperium due to the Munitorum sending forces like yours to defend Cadia instead of units better-equipped and trained for defensive actions?"

</br></br>C: "....We're done here. MacDuggan, why don't you show this gentleman the way out? You and the boys can give him a tuning before he leaves."

</br></br>[Transcript devolves into indecipherable noise as several new, raised voices enter the servo-skull's range, accompanied by what sounds like a lead pipe striking a coconut repeatedly before the servo-skull is abruptly turned off.]

<p class="magazine"><strong>VERGHAST AT WAR</strong>
  
</br></br>From mining laser to lasgun, the people of Excavius refuse to yield.

</br></br>Where once the hive cities drifted to sleep beneath the sound of mining drills and smelting hammers, a new sound fills the air. The crack of lasfire and the dying roars of greenskins hurling themselves into death!

</br></br>Only a week ago, these workers labored deep within the planet’s crust, drawing forth the elements that fuel the Emperor’s Crusades across the stars. Today, with those same calloused hands, they fight to defend the hives that gave them life.

</br></br>They are miners no longer, but loyal and brave soldiers of the Emperor. Shoulder to shoulder, they stood and fought. Every drop of blood repaid tenfold in Ork lives. For they have held the line. The great fleets of the Imperium have come. And so has the Emperor's wrath.
