<h2 class="title--large main-title">UNEXPECTED DELAYS FOR ADEPTA RESPONSE</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: .rayja</em>
</br></br>Dear noble and pious viewers. An embargo placed on all trade and tithe shipments from the Agri-World of Synkidrax III will bring about slight delays in Administratum and Adeptus Terra response times in select sectors. This comes after a recent investigation concerning possible radical mutations in select serf families revealing a possible Xenos Infiltration, and thus the Arbites have decreed a total embargo on all non-sanctioned contact between the planet and the Imperium at large.

</br></br>For those viewers who are ignorant of the purpose of Synkidrax III, it was an Agri-World noted for its production of Vellum and Vellum substitutes for the Administratum, and was considered a noted contributor to the administrative process in many more distant frontier sectors and regions in Segmentum Obscurus and Pacificus.

</br></br>Rest assured dear viewers that while major delays are expected to occur in many more distant systems in the frontier, most systems will see only minor ones as the Administratum works to secure temperary Vellum sources until the purge is complete, and of course we at the Imperial Times are stockpiled on parchment to ensure an accurate and truthful covering of events in a timely manner.

</br></br>The Emperor Protects.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">"FAITH IMPROVES HEALTH" SAYS OFFICIO MEDICAE</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: wellbreadedfish</em>
</br></br>Eight solar cycles ago, Master Physician Hadrianus of the Officio Medicae announced that having strong faith can improve one's health. In a sanctioned Administratum study, citizens that were able to recall more verses of the Canticum Imperialis showed greater robustness and focus on completing tasks. Reeducation was given to citizens overseen by the holy Ministorum to improve their faith, in accordance with new Officio Medicae recommendations.

</br></br>It is an unfortunate time of strife in the Imperium. However, the Administratum assures that with strong faith in the Emperor, Humanity can overcome any challenge. With these sactioned and approved results by the Officio Medicae, it is proven that the human will is our most powerful weapon, and our greatest tool.

</br></br>To support the Imperial citizenry in these times, and in light of the coming celebration of Sanguinala, the Officio Medicae has begun to gift citizens embellished copies of the Canticum Imperials. These copies have been carried by Imperial Guardsman who served on the frontlines and blessed by Pontifices of the Ecclesiarchy. Each citizen can receive their copy at their nearest Medicae clinic along with a discounted checkup.

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>Imperial subjects within the Baritone Sector, rejoice!

</br></br>For the first time since the abominable Intelligence choked the Vinta Subsector into a long silence and leaving our comrades cut off from the Emperor’s, loyal human souls have been found amidst the Golden Hallow system. Though cut off for untold decades, though adrift in ignorance and isolation, they yet endur­ed. Let no servant of the Throne doubt the Emperor. He has not abandoned His children. He merely awaits the hour of their return through his arms that are the Navis Imperialis and Astra Militarum. Where abominable logic and soulless abominations attempted to lay claim so arrogantly upon Imperial space, they found only the fury of true servants of the Throne. Their machine fiends were broken. Their heretek constructs shattered. Do not submit to the lies of the foe. Tolerance is a weakness, there can only be one to rule these stars and that is the Imperium of Man. Continue to resist the efforts of the abominations. They will try to sway you with sweet honeyed words, but they do not have your best interests in mind. Have faith that the Emperor’s crusade will reach you. And if we cannot bring salvation, then we will bring retribution.

</br></br>The Emperor Protects.

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: the Editor</em>
</br></br>The continued, unfathomable delay in announcing the winner of the Most Morbid and Prophetically Grimdark Deployment Document contest is now impacting core Imperial functions and has already resulted in widespread civil unrest.

</br></br>The Adeptus Arbites has publicly labeled the delay an act of "Criminal Administrative Incompetence," a charge usually reserved for egregious planetary mismanagement. They issued a final warning, stating that failure to announce the winning document within the next 48 hours will result in those responsible being placed on Mandatory Frontline Duty.

<p class="magazine"><strong>CAPTAIN ARORA DAVIS RETURNING TO DUTY</strong>
  
  </br></br>After suffering brutal injuries during the siege of Attrax II, one of the planet's most famed Captains was injured gruesomely in combat, losing an arm and a leg in the impact of an RPG. Despite the tragedy, her efforts had helped the survivors recover crucial data records from a command center on the frontlines, and helped turn the tide of the battle.

  </br></br>While Captain Davis was thought to have died in transit to more advanced medicae treatment off of the battlefield, duty rosters say she's returned to lead the men and women of the Astra Militarum once again. Not only has she returned from medicae treatments, rosters say that Davis has been promoted to the rank of Colonel and been trusted to command of the newly formed 21st Militarum Auxilia Infantry Regiment.
