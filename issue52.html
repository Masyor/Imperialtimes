<h2 class="title--large main-title">SKYFIRE OVER STROVAAN: IMPERIAL AIRCREW TURN THE TIDE</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: warwolf2003</em>
</br></br>Strovaan has been 10 Terran years without a tithe. The Intelligence Directorate’s final confirmation of full rebellion would lead to the deployment of Navis Imperialis and Astra Militarum forces. The PDF reportedly has collapsed, high value sites in peril, and rumors of the Archenemy are present. These rumors were confirmed. Below is a brief description of heroic actions taken by His Holy Majesty’s Aeronautica, footage of the event is available for 10 thrones, those that cannot afford it, below is the worded description of said heroics.

</br></br>In a show of Imperial bravado against the Archenemy, 2 heavy Behemoth SkyWraith gunships of the Burning Chariots flight, fresh from clearing hostile positions with surgical bombing, chose to “bolster morale” after their strike run. With their AWACs dubbed Sauron Actual, granting permission, they descended to the hard deck and thundered past the central reliquary spire in a tight two ship break. Flares arced out, blooming into twin silhouettes reminiscing avenging angels. Below, the Sisters of the Shield Defiant and Argent Shroud were attacking the site and were roused with a zealous cheer due to the display the 2 put on. Charging further into the reliquary to retake it from the Archenemy. It showed to the ground forces below that the orbital war was slowly but steadily turning to Imperial favor.

</br></br>That display however wasn’t a mere show. It threw off several incoming missiles and drew hostile attention away from extraction teams evacuating relic keepers from the lower vaults. What happened next, however, will be remembered far longer.
    
</br></br>Hours later, when the Chiroptean scout craft Oracle picked up a scrambled mass the size of a small continent moving beneath the clouds, it took sharp eyes and steadier nerves to realize what they’d found. It was not a ship, but an entire rebel carrier group, complete with a capital ship and screening escorts. Untouched by Imperial auspex nets, it was making a stealth advance on the eastern littoral, straight toward unfortified supply routes. They reported this immediately.

</br></br>In mere minutes, Sting and Smite Flights dove in to seize the opportunity, saturating the air with countermeasures to save the scout craft from a missile wave. The primed flares and dense radar bloom drew enemy ordnance off course, and in their wake, the lumbering Colossus, Strovaan Taskforce’s strategic bomber, managed to cut through unnoticed in the sky. Her Tech-Priests blessed the payload, opened the bay, and dropped the sanctified ordnance. It fell unopposed. The underwater detonation ruptured 3 traitor vessels outright, the shockwave capsized the remaining hulls. A full enemy carrier group was lost in seconds. Hundreds of enemy crew cast adrift. And Strovaan’s vital coastal corridors bought precious days of breathing room.

</br></br>This was not a planned operation, it was the initiatives these brave pilots took to deal the enemy a cutting blow. For their actions in stabilizing the reliquary defense, preserving Imperial extraction forces, and exposing the rebel capital fleet, several crewmembers have been recognized by the command staff of Commodore Andrea Veneziano. The Commodore, after such a stellar and valorous act, awarded these fine men and women.

</br></br>The Ribbon Intrinsic has been awarded collectively to Oracle Flight, whose discovery of the rebel fleet enabled the decisive strike.

</br></br>Recipients:
</br>– FltLt. Shun Marzik, Pilot
</br>– WO. Kaden Ross, WSO
</br>– WO. Petra Ghali, RIO
</br>– Tech-Adept Hiram Volis, Enginseer
    
</br></br>The Valorous Skies Badge has been awarded to the Burning Chariot 1-1 and 1-2 crews for lifesaving diversionary maneuvers under active missile threat and for actions that materially protected the reliquary garrison.

</br></br>Burning Chariot 1-1:
</br>– SqnLdr. Mikayel Dravett, Pilot
</br>– FltLt. Soren Daqi, Co-Pilot
</br>– Sgt. Kaleb Jornas, Bombardier
</br>– Cpl. Arjen Bellamy, Gunner
</br>– Cpl. Torin Johannsson, Gunner
</br>Burning Chariot 1-2:
</br>– FltLt. Nandita Veer, Pilot
</br>– FgOff. Halev Markov, Co-Pilot
</br>– FS. Otho Renquillo, Sensor Tech
</br>– Cpl. Jiro Tanaka, Gunner
</br>– Cpl. Elias Mbatha, Gunner

</br></br>The Winged Hammer Citation (Unit Award) For coordinated aerial deception under overwhelming threat, enabling a strategic-level victory.

</br>– Awarded to all personnel of Sting Flight and Smite Flight.

</br></br>The Halos of Aeronautica classed in Adamantium badge was awarded to Smite for solo navigating between radar shadows generated by Sting, the Smite bomber crew executed the sanctified drop that obliterated the rebel carrier group and saved the western littoral supply chain from collapse.

</br></br>Smite Flight Crew: 
</br>– SqnLdr. Rurik Halden, Pilot
</br>– FltLt. Serra Vayne, Co-Pilot
</br>– FgOff. Bronn Dacosta, Navigator/Bombardier
</br>– Tech-Pilot Adept Karh Voxen, Auspicator/WSO
</br>– Sgt. Helio Dravik, Dorsal Gunner
</br>– Cpl. Evanthia Ro, Ventral Gunner
</br>– Tech-Adept Rhel Carment, Enginseer

</br></br>The Halos of Aeronautica classed in Theldrite badge was also issued to the Primaris Lighting flight, Sting, that dove to sea level to generate a massive, shifting chaff bloom, drawing the rebel fleet’s entire anti-air volley into a phantom contact. Command analysts have already noted that without Sting’s deliberate radar signature shaping, the Colossus would likely have faced a direct carrier-group killbox and not survived ingress.

</br></br>Sting Flight Members:
</br>– SqnLdr. Aurelio Makhadan, Flight Lead
</br>– FltLt. Lena Voight, Wing Lead
</br>– FgOff. Toland Revez, Pilot
</br>– FgOff. Mei-Lin Kasshari, Pilot
</br>– FgOff. Joseph Adu-Kore, Pilot

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">"LAMIA PRIME—STRATEGIC SUPPLY HUB ROCKED BY SUDDEN UPRISING</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>Lamia Prime was long regarded as a quiet, industrious jewel in the inner marches of the Orpheonic Reach within the Segmentum Obscurus, It was thrown into turmoil yesterday as multiple manufactorum districts in the planetary heartland erupted into open revolt. The unrest, which began in the early shift cycle within the steelworks of Vantorus Hive, quickly spread through adjacent worker stacks and transit yards, prompting widespread lockdowns across the world’s primary production centers.

</br></br>Governor-Marshal Elena Voss, speaking from her palace bastion atop the Bastionis Plateau, assured the wider sector that the situation remains “firmly under control.” In her address she dismissed the uprising as “a localized insurrection instigated by agitators with offworld connections,” insisting that loyalist enforcer cohorts and her personal Household Guard had already begun “pacification measures.”

</br></br>Lamia Prime is a crucial node in the region’s logistics web. Its manufactoria supply wagon parts for Mechanicus engine crawlers, pressure seals for voidship armor repairs, and bulk rations for several regiments rotating through the Serevan Dominate Front. Even before the uprising, Administratum clerks had noted strain on Lamia Prime’s output due to aging infrastructure and chronic worker shortages. With major transit zones now compromised, sector logisticians warn that delays in material shipments are inevitable.

</br></br>The Lamian Trade Guilds, historically cooperative but protective of their shipping rights, issued a joint communique urging offworld commanders to “exercise patience” as convoys are rerouted through smaller, less efficient ports. Several merchant captains have already reported extended anchor times in orbit due to heightened security checks.

</br></br>Although Governor Voss continues to project confidence, vox-relays from independent observers describe a more complex event. Loyalist forces are engaged in active fighting through the lower gantries of Vantorus and Tymbra Hives, with smoke plumes visible as far as the southern reactor plain. The extent of the uprising’s coordination remains unclear.

</br></br>Imperial commanders stationed throughout the Orpheonic Reach are monitoring developments closely. While no outside deployment has been ordered, the Departmento Munitorum has already marked Lamia Prime’s supply quotas for review pending stabilization of the world. For now, Governor Voss insists that the unrest will be “quelled swiftly and decisively.” But until the manufactoria lines roar back to life, regiments across the sector should prepare for tightened rations, spare parts, and general repairs.

      <h5>Administratum Updates</h5>
<p class="magazine"><strong>SANGUINALA CANCELLED</strong>
  
  </br></br>After a labour strike upon forge world Septentrionalis Polaris Sanguinala has been cancelled . Septentrionalis Polaris is a minor forge world dedicated to the production of sanctioned Sanguinala decorations and is the dominant provider of decorations for the imperium from Maccrage to Terra. Without Septentrionalis Polaris the imperium expects a 7% decline of the Sanguinala supplies affecting thousands of worlds within the imperium.  Lord Regent Robute Guiliman the Avenging son has dispatched Battle Group Julianius of the Indomiatus Crusade to mediate and bring order to the forge world. In the meantime the Ecclesiarchy are in the midst of a civil war over re-sanctifying old Sanguinala deocrations.

<p class="magazine"><strong>WORKERS UPRISING ON ERIDAN PRIME</strong>
  
  </br></br>The Imperial World of Eridan Prime suffers from a sudden Workers Uprising. The workers of Eridan Primes factories unionized under the so called "Four-armed Union" and attacked several administrative buildings. They occupied factories specialized to the production of various metal plates and demand better pay, free healthcare, better treatment of mutants as well as the total control over Eridan Prime and the death of the Governor.

  </br></br>Governor Aurel referred to the demands as "non-negotiable" and declared martial law. The Four-armed Union will be "disarmed, dismantled, destroyed and their filthy mutants grinded into nutrient paste, which is then to be thrown away", so Aurel. When asked, if outside assistance is needed, the Governor shot our correspondent.

<p class="magazine"><strong>CONTACT MADE WITH LOST KNIGHT WORLD</strong>
  
  </br></br>During a scouting operation conducted by a Navy fleet, Imperial forces have stumbled across a former Knight World seemingly reduced to a Death World. While thought to be uninhabited, short range communications were intercepted while orbiting the planet of Salachar. After establishing a communication network, Imperial forces were able to identify several living members, and provide some supplies in a minor relief effort.

  </br></br>While the planet was found in shambles, with severely limited supplies, some Knight forces remained intact, thanks to efforts by the planetary Mechanicus presence. With organization efforts between the Knight houses, Mechanicus, and Imperial Navy, they were able to organize the transport of an Imperial Knight to help fight under the Imperium once again.

  </br></br>Hopefully, given some time and resources, many more Knights will be able to recover, and be utilized by Imperial forces to bring glorious ruin upon the enemies of mankind.
