<h2 class="title--large main-title">CELEBRATION OF THE 50TH ERA INDOMITUS ARTICLE BY THE ECCLESIARCHY</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: .rayja</em>
</br></br>Dear Readers, as many of you shall know, this issue is the 50th of The Imperial Times released since the beginning of this new and eventful era under the watch of our Revered Lord Regent to the God-Emperor, The Avenging Son, Roboute Guilliman, blessed be his name forevermore. Through our mandate to provide accurate, encouraging, and holy news, we have covered such a wide variety of topics and victories for our blessed Imperium. You dear viewers, have also helped to ensure that the darkness of heresy and misinformation is squandered by a faithful reading of our issues, as the only true news from Terra. And as we prepare to enter into another half-century of triumphs, we have received warm congratulations and praise from the variety of Adeptus' on Terra and beyond.

</br></br>And while these are deeply appreciated and alights ours souls with such warmth of confirmation, we want to dedicate this segment of the new issue to a particular message we received, and we hope you dear viewers can appreciate such holy words as we have here at the Imperial Times.

</br></br>"From Chael Kardranno of Shrine World Hellion V, Bishop of the Cathedral of The Beneficent God-Emperor and His Holy Majesty's Adeptus Ministorum. To the faithful men and women of The Imperial Times, I will keep this message brief and direct since no doubt you are working constantly to ensure the holy words of Terra are reverberated across the galaxy. I wish to dedicate this message to celebrating your constant efforts to alight the souls of mankind, wherever they may be, with the power of correct information and detailed coverage of this Blessed Era of The Lord Regent. I will only ask of you to keep steady on this path, and to continue your holy work, for as we in the Ministorum work to save the souls of mankind, so shall your work save the mind of mankind. 'Allow nothing save the grace of him on the throne to guide the hands of the righteous', Benedictions 28:123."

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">HONORING HIS FAITHFUL</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: wellbreadedfish</em>
</br></br>To live is to serve the glory of the Imperium, and none can be said that there is no greater life than the one who has given it in sacrifice. We live in an era of untold heroes, martyrs, and saints who fight in the name of the Emperor. They bring His light to the farthest corners of the galaxy, purging the alien, the heretic, and the mutant. For there is no greater honor, no greater glory, than service.

</br></br>But there are those whose faith is stronger than the darkness surrounding them, that even in death, it shines bright as a beacon for others to follow. On 8.201+NHS.M42, the entire 94th Nolgrian Shock Regiment perished while battling the forces of chaos in the Imperium Nihilus.

</br></br>The 94th Nolgrian Shock Regiment faithfully defended their home world of Nolgria from an invading host of chaos spawn. Refusing to deny the enemy the satisfaction of fear, the 94th charged into the warpstorm with steel in hand, fire in their hearts, and fury in their eyes. Such was the ferocity of their hate, citizen survivors recall the colonel of the regiment, Vittoria Arrianus, holding the entrance of the storm by herself as she held onto the regiment's standard, refusing to let it fall. Further accounts tell that not a single daemon penetrated the 94th's offensive line.

</br></br>Expedient action spurs faith and the 94th acted with honor and intent. Their explosive reaction to the chaos invasion allowed Nolgrian regiments to muster in time and stage a proper defense. The invading chaos spawn are being driven back slowly, but surely, in the Emperor's name. In honor of the 94th Nolgrain Shock Regiment's faith, the Bell of Lost Souls will ring in respect for their colonel. It shall ring out in reverence on 8.290+TSS.M42.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">ORKS ON EXCRUCIA!</h2>

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>EXCRUCIA PRIME — The long-anticipated Greenskin incursion has finally descended upon the Excrucia Sector, yet Imperial High Command reports unshakable confidence in the world’s defenses. What some fringe agitators would call a “major invasion,” our commanders instead describe as a glorious opportunity to reaffirm the Emperor’s dominion over this sector.

</br></br>Early this morning, citizens witnessed the brilliant spectacle of the Imperial Navy’s ships cutting down countless Ork vessels in the upper atmosphere. Defense officials have confirmed that thousands of Greenskin craft were annihilated before they could even make planetfall due to the valor of the Segmentum Tempestus Fleet and attached Astartes strike forces. Ground forces across the planet echo similar sentiments. Astra Militarum regiments, Planetary Defense Brigades, and local fortress garrisons report full readiness. The Death Korps is especially eager as the 85th Line Korps of Hive Death have drawn first blood against the ancient enemy.

</br></br>Even more reassuring to the faithful, elements of the Ultramarines and Imperial Fists have been confirmed present on the frontlines. Reports from the western hives indicate that fortification efforts were completed a full week ahead of schedule, allowing Astartes leaders to optimize deployment with God-Emperor blessed precision. Citizens are encouraged to remain calm, stay indoors unless assigned to approved labor or defense duties, and continue offering prayers to the Master of Mankind. Morale remains extremely high across all sectors, and officials remind the public that panic is the Orks’ greatest ally.

</br></br>The Emperor Protects.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">RISE OF THE MILITARUM AUXILIA</h2>

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: _coati_</em>
</br></br>Abhumans have long been a foul stench on the greater Imperium, although with the fall of major Imperial strongholds, and some changes in the needs of the Imperium, this view is still shifting. Some Imperial Generals have gone as far as to praise their efforts and request their extended cooperation with localized regiments.

</br></br>While clearly a matter of great controversy and debate, there have been recent efforts to increase their use as expendable troops. Recent tactics have involved letting the abhumans die as penitents in the most hazardous frontlines the Imperium has to offer, saving important guardsmen for greater fights.

</br></br>In the last decade, over 6 abhuman regiments have been erected under direct oversight of up and coming Generals, alongside recognizable veteran Colonels, the newest of such being the 21st Auxilia Infantry Regiment, lead by Colonel Arora Davis. While some appreciate the extra bodies, others question the direction the Imperium is taking by allowing them more independent service.

</br></br>For now, all the Imperium can do is watch with great scrutiny, and trust in the Guard to take proper action.

<p class="magazine"><strong>THE DEATH OF HEROES</strong>
  
  </br></br>The Imperium Of Man is the only bastion of humanity agaisnt the heretical warp xenos and xenos of the reality. Year after year heroes of the imperium sacrifice their lives in the name of the emperor of mankind and his glorious imperium. Yet these heroes often go unsung and their deeds lost. Even the greatest heroes among the imperium are lost witin the ravages of time. How many Citizens Remember Saint Vidar and his miracle that liberated the Corinth Sector or Chapter Master Kulvak and the Solar Knights. Many heroes of the imperium go unsung or are lost in time. So i besech you my fellow imperial Citizen Donate now to your sector's Cemetary World. For the master of mankind and his faithful warriors.

<p class="magazine"><strong>THE LIBERATION OF GON</strong>
  
  </br></br>The Emperor has heard our prayers. Despite the heavy onslaught of WAAAGH Gothmog, the Imperium send a Liberation force to the planet of Gon. Its capital, Suntower City, home to the revered Tarot of the Adamantine Tower, holds out still. Relief from the ongoing siege will break the hold of the Xenos and make way for further assets to assist.

  </br></br>A Prefectus from the Department of Final Consideration of the sub-sector has made clear, that until Suntower city is safely back in imperial hands, no further reinforcements will be allocated. It is for the Liberation Force to prove their faith in the Emperor and save this world from the tyranny of the ork.

<p class="magazine"><strong>BATTLEGROUP CANCELLED</strong>
  
  </br></br>Battlegroup Vengeance, en route to the embattled Bellator Gap to relieve the hard-pressed defenders resisting the Chaos incursion, has been halted. Abruptly, entirely, and without warning! According to dispatches, one Senior Tithe-Auditor Jager, the official responsible for signing the final red-ink authorization to release troop rations, fuel allocations, and munitions requisitions... has simply vanished.

  </br></br>No leave of absence filed or trace of desertion found. Without his hallowed seal? Well, regulations are regulations, and so the mighty war-host of the Imperium that included Titans, Astartes, and fleets were forced to stand down. This unfortunate delay will cause many to perish. But remember, they are lives under the Emperor's watchful gaze and endless mercy. Though the tides of war surge and the shadows lengthen,
He protects, always.
