    <h2 class="title--large main-title">THE ATTACK ON SCHONBACHEN HAS BEGUN!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: warclaimer</em>
</br></br>Today on [DATE REDACTED BY ORDO CHRONOS] at around 1700 local time, the forces that had mustered in Remali have finally began engaging enemy forces in the city of Schonbachen, even from the spires and vantage points of Remali, as the sun sets this reporter can verify the undeniable flashes of combat as shades of yellow, blue, and red paint the area in a flurry of holy combat. 
    
</br></br>In other related news we have just received reports of combat also beginning across the line, it seems that battle has finally arrived all along the front and the demise of the heretics is likely soon to come.

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: beardog2150</em>
</br></br>A mere 11 months after scurrilous laborers on the vital mineral-rich moon of Gruna 9E03 declared a "strike" for "improved working conditions", the disorder has been ended by an enforced peace at the hands of the Priesthood of Mars.  Surprisingly this includes acceding to several rebel demands, including a new program of augmetic replacement for injured or diseased miners.  

</br></br>When Governor Scrump protested the ruinous cost, he was apparently informed that 'your profits are irrelevant' and 'the ore must flow'.  A bizarre outcome, yet none are permitted to doubt the reason of the Adeptus Mechanicus!

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">CHAOS ERUPTS ON DAMASCLIAN PRIMUS</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: paladintakezo</em>
</br></br>Chaos erupts on Damasclian Primus as seven prominent members of House Orliangathrope were found dead in their beds, each one pierced through the heart with a wooden stake. Stranger still is that insider sources claim that six of the seven corpses had underwent some sort of metamorphosis in their death throes, turning into some sort of monstorous half-man, half-bat abberations. 

</br></br>House Orliangathrope has issued no statement on the veracity of these rumors, but multiple witnesses have provided similar accounts that the House is building up their security and bringing large amounts of both weaponry and servants into the Orliangathrope estate.

</br></br>The Damasclian Daily promises to keep it's readers up-to-date and informed about the situation as it unfolds.

      <h5>Administratum Updates</h5>
<p class="magazine">The temporary and regrettable lapse in our publication schedule has now been rectified. The cause of this delay was the mandatory absence of the Editor-in-Chief, who was required to participate in the sacred Rites of Final Mortal Passage. This week-long service was for a high-ranking patriarch, whose mortal vessel required final cleansing on a remote feudal world.

</br></br>The solemn duty of ensuring an ancestor's soul is properly commended to the Emperor's divine grace is paramount and must, for a brief time, supersede all other administrative functions. While the process was arduous and the logistics of travel to the isolated ceremonial grounds proved challenging, the rites were completed with the reverence demanded by the Imperial Creed.

</br></br>The Editor-in-Chief has now returned to the primary scribetoriums. We apologize for any disruption to the timely flow of sanctioned information and assure all loyal citizens that The Imperial Times is now back on its vigilant schedule, ever ready to distribute the Emperor's truth.
