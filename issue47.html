</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>In the far reaches of the Southeastern Fringes of the Ultima Segmentum, there has been a record low in piracy, a feat credited to the unyielding vigilance of the Navis Imperialis and the decisive actions of several Rogue Trader Houses who have grown weary of the frontier’s lawlessness. These bold Lord-Captains, driven by piety, have joined forces with the Navis Imperialis to strike back against the criminals whose brazen and selfish greed sought to rob honest Imperial merchants of their livelihoods.

</br></br>Rumors persist among voidfarers that the Emperor’s Angels have also taken part in the purges, silently descending upon pirate strongholds before vanishing into the warp once more. Though no official record confirms their involvement. Whatever the truth, it is clear that the xeno thieves and heretical brigands who once plagued these routes are no longer a threat. Local merchant guilds and trade cartels, particularly those operating along the Vornic Run and Helix Drift, have lauded the Navy’s renewed presence. Trade throughout the sector has increased by 28%, restoring the essential flow of luxury goods, valuable minerals, and agri-stock to frontier colonies. It is also mentioned that a few Rogue Trader families have invested a substantial amount in previously unknown expanses. Allowing the Navis Imperialis fleets to operate with a close supply line so far from the known territories of the Imperium of Man. Providing more security for Imperial colonists on the frontier from xeno incursions or raids.

</br></br>Remember Imperial Citizens, the Litany of Disgust for the prayer of your planet’s cycle.

</br></br>Each alien destroyed is a soul freed from eternal bondage. Each mortal alien life extinguished is a human soul raised to glory. Thus our eternal destiny is written in the blood of the alien. With sword and spear; destroy the alien. With cannon shot and gun blast, smash the alien. With laser and soaring plasma, scatter the alien to the stars. With tooth and fist and hammer blows. With axe and shell and poison and bombs. With virus charges and thermal mines. Kill them all.

</br></br>The Emperor Protects.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">ORK WAAAAAGH! APPROACHES EXCRUCIA</h2>

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: .rayja</em>
</br></br>Within the Segmentum Tempestus, a minor Ork WAAAAGH! has begun on the frontier of the Ultima Segmentum and the filthy Xenos are en route to the borders of the Segmentum Solar, the heart of our God-Emperor's Noble Imperium. In response to such a threat, two forces of the Emperor's Angels have deployed their forces in order to put an end to such a threat to the throneworld before it can begin. The Lord Regent's Ultramarines, may his name be praised, 5th company, The Wardens of the Eastern Fringe, and the 3rd Company of the Imperial Fists, the Sentinels of Terra, have been have been confirmed by Astropathy to be seen appraoching the hive world of Excrucia in the Cynrath system, which sits on the holy border between the Sanctified Solar Segmentum and  The Blessed Ultima Segmentum. It is here that the Angels of The God-Emperor of Mankind, may he be worshipped forevermore, intend to stop the vile Xenos in their tracks before even one tainted soul can reach the holy stardust of Solar.

</br></br>Standing with pride and zealotry alongside the divine angels are a number of military forces, including the PDF garrisons of Excrucia, numbering around 18 billion, with each one dedicated to the defense of the God-Emperor's holy Imperium. Returning for the defense of their home is the Excrucian Roaches' Army Group, joined by the 39th Death Korps of Krieg Siege Army Corps as well, totaling up to 540 million men and woman of the Emperor's Astra Militarum, dedicated to giving their lives for the will of our Divine Master of Mankind.

</br></br>According to our Estimations, by the time this report reaches you viewers, the filthy and barbaric Orks will have reached Excrucia and will have no doubt shed first blood upon its hive cities' walls, with each death of a xenos an act of worship towards the God-Emperor.

</br></br>Remember Imperial Citizens, recite the Prayer In The Time of The Tumults for the pious defenders of Excrucia.

</br></br>"Emperor of Man, overseer of all things right,
</br>Whose powers none can resist,
</br>Save and deliver us, we beseech,
</br>From the hands of our enemies,
</br>By granting us dominion over them,
</br>Show us the path to victory,
</br>That we might produce it in Your undying name."

</br></br>The Emperor Protects.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">CIVIL UNREST ON THE HORIZON?</h2>

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: The Editor</em>

      </br></br>The persistent delay in announcing the winner of the Grimdark Document Contest has been pinpointed, not to heresy or sabotage, but to the Archival Adjudication Subcommittee for Standardized Seal and Stamp Compliance (AASS-SC). The committee has halted all final rulings, demanding that every single document submitted must first pass a re-certification of its submission seal's aesthetic conformity. Citizens, already agitated by the lack of sanctioned despair, are now further infuriated by the sheer administrative paralysis. The Adeptus Arbites maintains heightened vigilance, reminding the public that protesting bureaucratic precision is illegal.

</br></br>In a stunning display of ungratefulness, the world of Verghast has declared "Independence" from the imperium. Already 7 regiments have begun to mobalize including the Gothumbrian 243rd, the 22nd Gothumbrian Airborn as well as elements from krieg and cadia. The Voidwar is expected to go well according to Lord Admiral Helm Ducat. Currently an embargo has been placed halting all goods going to and from the planet. 

</br></br>Those who had done business there are being investigated by the Adeptus Arbites to route out the heretics who dared declare succession. Already several noble families suspected of strengthening the worlds economic power leading up the succession have been executed by Arbitrators and a dozen more have had their assets frozen.

</br></br>FRONTLINE, GARRON VI. Just as heretic forces broke through Imperial defenses yesterday, strange figures cut through the clouds — sleek, flame-wreathed warriors unlike any known to the local Guard forces. Later identified as Aeldari warriors calling themselves the Cinderwing Corsairs.

</br></br>They struck the heretics with blinding speed and vanished before dawn, leaving only scorched ground and vanquished heretics in their wake.

</br></br>Imperial Command offers no comment, though whispers abound. Were they allies, opportunists, or something more? As one Guardswoman put it: “They saved us. But I don’t think it was for our sake.”
