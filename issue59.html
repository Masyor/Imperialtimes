        <div style="column-count: 3; column-gap: 40px;">
          <p><em>From: beardog2150</em></p>

<p>Emperor be praised!  Over a year ago, His Divine Majesty's Ship Enterprize was caught in an ambush by the perfidious xenos.  While she survived, the voidship was grievously wounded, and returned to spacedock for urgent repair work.  Her fate was in question for these many long months, but at long last we may report to you that her vital systems have been made whole, her crew replenished, and under the leadership of Lord Captain Oceanus McClelland, she shall venture forth once more into the void to secure the blessings of victory and prosperity for the Imperium!</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to speak with the Lord Captain aboard the Enterprize and to walk its halls to see the state of the voidship for myself.  Having won the somber nickname 'The Gray Ghost' by virtue of its livery, as well as its dispatch seeming certain despite its lingering presence in dock, I can assure the readers that the vessel is in fine fettle, its crew hale and in good spirits!  The Lord Captain, a proud and long-serving veteran of the Imperial Navy, spoke to me of the ship's excellent condition, with only some lingering annoyances to be repaired while underway - although thanks to the tireless labors of Imperial voidsmen alongside the genius of the Adeptus Mechanicus, that should be trivial enough.</p>

<p>Be sure to say a prayer for the captain and crew of the HDMS Enterprize as they venture into the frightful void once more!  Their return to service is a sign of the Emperor's benediction, and their efforts stand between us and all the foes of man waiting in the dark!</p>

      <h3>My Genestealer Maid Cant Be This Cute : A heretical Literature. </br>( Opinion Piece)</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 12px;"><em>From: someguui</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">It has come to the attention to the Staff of the imperial times that a Heretical Smut Literature was discovered in the imperial times Callixis Branch Office known as My Genestealer Maid Cant Be This Cute. The book follows the heretical account of a Planetary Governor falling in love with a Genestealer maid and their secret illicit romance. While the novel is banned across the imperium copies of the Novel have ran rampant upon the higher echelon circles of Imperial Noblity. One Inquisitor even suspects several Gene stealer Uprisings to be the result of the spread of the Heretical Works.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px;">The Discovery was made by an inquisitor tracking down the Author of the heretical work where they suspect the Author to be of the Calixis branch of the Imperial Times. Until Further Notice all Works and personnel  from the Calixis Office is under the highest scrutiny by Lord Inquisitor Rambal.</p>

        <h2>In Regards to the Slander and Defamation from the Regional Office of the Imperial Times</h2>
      <div style="column-count: 2; column-gap: 40px;">
          <p><em>From: .angrytech</em></p>

<p>We at the Calixis Branch of the Imperial Times vehemently object to the opinion piece "My Genestealer Maid Can't Be This Cute: A Heretical Literature," recently brought to our attention as published by malicious actors within the regional headquarters of the Imperial Times. </p>

<p>The Author of this despicable piece of heretical literature is not a member of our staff. </p>

<p>Discovery of this abominable filth of "literature" was discovered during a routine surprise inspection from the local Arbites forces, within the desk of a junior editor for our 'Beyond the Expanse' local editorial. Upon discovery, we immediately agreed to work with authorities to root out the potential depth of heresy within our own walls, and have continued to do so even after Lord Inquisitor Rambal took notice as part of his ongoing efforts to find the writer of this and other heretical fictions and bring them to Imperial Justice.</p>

<p>We would be remit in our duties if we did not announce that this junior editor, who has only been in our department for two Terran-standard years, was originally from the same regional headquarters branch of the Imperial Times that now allows for opinion pieces to slander its own co-workers. We have relayed this information posthaste to the Lord Inquisitor, who has assured us that he will be investigating this new lead imminently.</p>

<p>Abhor the alien, the mutant, and ESPECIALLY the heretic, dear readers. We will resume out standard releases as soon as this investigation has concluded, hopefully with another update from our highly-anticipated Famine in Footfall series!! </p>

        <div style="column-count: 3; column-gap: 40px;">
          <p><em>From: mourhurst</em></p>

<p>The Greenskins have been broken by the might of the Astra Militarum and Navis Imperialis. After 93 cycles of continuous siege warfare, orbital bombardment, and ground assaults of unprecedented ferocity, Imperial authorities have formally declared the planet Excrucia liberated from Greenskin occupation. The final Ork concentrations were annihilated in a decisive counteroffensive coordinated between the Astra Militarum, Planetary Defense Forces, Imperial Navy, and the Emperor’s Angels.</p>

<p>Victory followed shortly after the Imperial Fist 3rd Company Captain baited and slew the Ork Warboss leading the WAAAGH and caused the subsequent collapse of enemy cohesion. Once the Greenskins began fighting amongst each other, it was an easy mop up. The remaining Greenskin forces were drawn into prepared kill-zones and eradicated with extreme prejudice. Trillions of Orks lie dead as civilian helpers from other sectors are being brought in by the billions to aid in purifying the world so that feral Orks do not sprout and dare challenge the world once more. By the grace of the Emperor and the unyielding valor of His servants, Excrucia is secure. The Greenskin threat has been erased. Now is the time to clean up and remember the glorious martyrs who have given their lives in service to the Golden Throne. However, 15 out of the 21 major hive cities lay in ruin, leaving many who managed to survive in the wastelands without a home, but worse yet, the supporting infrastructure that helped the Hives live harmoniously is now broken as each Hive had a purpose for the planet’s self sustaining abilities. </p>

<p>In coordination with the Adeptus Administratum, many calls have been made to loyal worlds, guilds, and private benefactors to contribute to the Excrucian Reconstruction. Including a request to you.</p>
          
          <p>Your donation will provide:</p>
          <ul><li>Emergency hab-blocks for displaced citizens</li>
<li>Reactivation of vital manufactorum chains</li>
<li>Purification teams to scour lingering Greenskin spores</li>
<li>Rations, medicae supplies, and labor tools for survivors</li>
            <li>Shrine reconstruction to restore proper Imperial worship</li></ul>

          <p>Every throne given honors the fallen. The Emperor Protects.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 48px; text-align: center;">HOLY DUTY AND OVERWORKING</h2>
        <div style="column-count: 3; column-gap: 40px;">
          <p><em>From: .rayja</em></p>

<p>It is no surprise and quite common knowledge amongst you, our dear and noble viewers, that the majority of the Imperium's billion souls hold lives of work, duty, and faith. While we at the Imperial Times and the Adeptus Terrra may focus and give attention to those deserving and valiant defenders of our God-Emperor's Holy Imperium, we mus'nt forget that their efforts are supported by the efforts of countless worlds across the galaxy, providing tithe to Terra in order to enforce The Emperor's domain across the stars.</p>

<p>On these countless worlds, of course, lie thousands to billions of workers. They work away from Solar dawn to dusk, within the unending manufactorums of hive cities, the boundless horizons of an Agri-World plantation, and the deepest depths of a mine, just to name a few. Indeed, I would wager a significant amount of thrones that almost all of you dear viewers are also within this category, spending whatever time is allotted to you with us, The Imperial Times, in order to understand the truth from Terra.</p>

<p>And so while I would encourage those amongst you to whom death from exhaustion is nothing short of an honor in glorious duty, I would also like to ask you, the dear pious and humble workers of this Sanctified Imperium, to know your limits. A duty to the Emperor is one that lasts a lifetime, and far too often I have seen eager menials who give their lives without realizing the extent of their remaining journey. Your duty to the Emperor lies not just in working, but it may also lie in siring the new generation, serving in your planet's defense forces, or helping to spread the message of His Most Holy And Divine God-Emperor of Humanity. And so while for many of you, duty may end in the darkness of the assembly line, I would encourage you to hold on, to understand your place in The God-Emperor's divine plan for us all, and to never allow the darkness to enrapture the light of your faithful soul. The God-Emperor Protects.</p>
