    <h2 class="title--large main-title">FIRST CONTACT IN OBLIVION</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: shrimplicit</em>
</br></br>Currently a large number of Imperial Forces have gathered in the Oblivion sector to restore order, following reports of an unknown Xenos force attacking Imperial outposts. Among the deployed troops are Imperial Guard Regiments, as well as selected Astartes, Adeptus Mechanicus and Inquisitorial troops, united under the leadership of the esteemed Lord General Militant Campos. Shortly after the arrival of the combined Imperial Forces, the honor of making first contact with the enemy fell to the 3rd Artosian Cervid Armoured Mechanized Regiment. 

</br></br>On a scouting mission to Orryx, a world that has seen its fair share of war and is currently uninhabited, cowardly enemy forces had laid an ambush. Mere moments after the arrival of our brave Imperial Guardsmen enemy Anti-Air targeted their Sky-Talons. Thanks to the Imperial pilots excellent training and unparalleled equipment this underhanded attack yielded no results for the enemy, while giving away the enemies position. The 3rd Artosian immediately started a counterattack fielding heavy armoured divisions. In a swift and onesided slaughter they managed to subdue the enemy and destroy a significant number of their attack vehicles. 

</br></br>Among the Imperial forces a small number of armored vehicles were damaged and 40 heroes of the Imperium rendered the ultimate service unto the Emperor and gave their lives for this decisive victory. Our Imperial Guardsmen were able to recover their own, along with a substantial number of defeated enemy troops and vehicles. The valiant heroes of the 3rd Artosian were buried with the appropriate Artosian funeral rites. The captured enemies are on transport to the nearby headquarters of Lord General Militant Campos for analysis. The Imperium anticipates a swift and complete victory over the vile Xenos. The Emperor protects!

<h2 class="title--large main-title">PHOSPHEX STC SECURED</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: tidus1307</em>
</br></br>With banners high and faith unbroken, the valiant forces of the Imperium have claimed a decisive and righteous victory upon the world of Acerbus. After a protracted and bitter struggle, the holy STC for Phosphex, once believed to be lost forever to time, has at last been reclaimed!

</br></br>The campaign, hailed already by high command as one of the great triumphs of the current century, saw the tireless advance of His Majesty’s finest: the indomitable Death Korps of Krieg, the sacred Adepta Sororitas, the elite Tempestus Scions, and the fabled Angels of Death, among countless others too noble to name. Each warrior, a paragon of loyalty. Each fallen, a saint of war.

</br></br>While our brave soldiers fought amidst the ruins below, a dire void conflict erupted in the heavens above. Reports confirm that a corrupted Magos in service to sources most foul attempted to sabotage the Imperial effort. Thanks to the valor of the Imperial Navy, and the Emperor’s guiding hand, the heretic was silenced in the cold dark of space.

</br></br>In the bloodied trenches of Acerbus, courage reached heights few could dream. Fragmentary vox-recordings speak of a slain Sister of Battle, her body broken but her spirit aflame, rising amidst the dead to lead a final charge. Glowing with holy light, she is said to have delivered a speech that stirred even the most despairing soul to rise and fight anew.

</br></br>The Word Bearers had attempted to defy their fates as the sky burned. In a last act of devotion, entire platoons of loyal warriors gave their lives. Martyring themselves, buying time for their comrades to strike the killing blow and reclaim what was once lost.

</br></br>It was only right that the final resistance of the traitors met its end within the sacred halls of the cathedrals.

</br></br>For it was there, beneath shattered stained glass and amidst the burning incense of war, that the Emperor’s gaze fell most keenly. Witness to the struggle, He guided the hands of the faithful. Through His divine will, victory was granted.

</br></br>And now, with the Phosphex STC in sacred hands once more, the forge-worlds stir with promise. Let the heretics tremble. Let the enemies of mankind despair.

</br></br>The Emperor had watched. And He was pleased.

<h2 class="title--large main-title">THE GREAT DEVOURER PASSES</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: dankest0130</em>
</br></br>Across Sub-sector Commodus, countless billions celebrate the passing of Hive Fleet Hydra, having seemingly retreated from whence it came. For months, Imperial forces have been mustering on the five worlds of the sub-sector, fortifying them in defense against the invading xenos and stockpiling resources for the coming storm. The assembled contingent of Commodus’s shield includes multiple naval battlegroups, thirty-eight Imperial Guard regiments, and astartes from twelve chapters, along with each world’s local PDF. 

</br></br>Though there is no doubt that the Imperium would have triumphed again, as it always has, it appears Hydra lacks the stomach to even put up a fight against the Imperium’s might. The vile xenos have turned away with their tail between their legs from Sub-sector Commodus. Experts have concluded that the xenos could truly know fear and likely turned away seeking an easier meal, and are analyzing where the xenos are fleeing to next.

</br></br>But for now, we focus on Commodus. Celebrations have spread across the sub-sector, and planetary governors have allowed an unprecedented two hours of respite in work shifts across the designated week of festivities. For the moment, the mustered forces remain garrisoned in Commodus. The Imperial Guard are in for a short impromptu leave, concerning themselves with marching in parades rather than dispatching the Emperor’s foe.

<h2 class="title--large main-title">FURTHER INTO THE ABYSS</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: harrydugg</em>
</br></br>Following the coordinated assault on the twin bastions located within the  Eye of Terror,  North East of the initial drop site, Imperial commanders now confirm several disturbing developments that point to an escalating warp presence across the theatre. The strongholds, separated by several kilometers, appeared to respond as if tethered—damage inflicted upon one mirrored precisely on its counterpart. Structural collapses, flame patterns, and even explosions occurred in perfect symmetry, as if bound by sorcerous threads.

</br></br>Multiple frontline reports confirm that heretical psykers—believed to be Chaos Sorcerers—engaged Imperial units at both sites. Witnesses described the air splitting with unnatural static and the battlefield warping with illusions and screaming whispers. Several Guardsmen were driven to madness or confusion, firing upon allies or dropping to their knees in despair. Some Knights and Astartes reported flashes of past traumas or impossible visions flickering at the edge of perception.

</br></br>Most damning, however, is the confirmed loss of the 285th Vostroyan Armored Regiment. Vox contact with the regiment ceased moments after their lead elements entered a dense stormfront east of the bastions. Orbital augurs captured the emergence of a violent, green-tinged warp anomaly—matching no known weather patterns—which howled like a thousand damned souls. Within minutes, the entire regiment was gone. Only cracked, scorched tracks and half-melted hull fragments remained when scouts dared to re-enter the area.

</br></br>Imperial High Command has since declared the region an area of extreme danger and advised all forces to prepare for further warp anomalies. Strategic leadership is expected to consolidate remaining Knight assets and Space Marine detachments into a spearhead formation, as scattered assaults prove increasingly perilous.
