    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: someguui</em>
</br></br>Tech Priest Garla has been expelled from the Hive World Mercurla after their revisions of the Corspe Starch Processor has been deemed too safe by the Corpse Starch Guild. The Techpriest had retreived ancient data on guard rails and infared sensors to prevent workers from falling into the grinding gears of the Corpse starch proccessor. As a result Corpse Starch Yields have dropped by 3% and many consumers have detailed that the latest batch of Starch has been lacking its typical complex flavours.

    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: amarain12</em>
</br></br>On a distant ice world, the 4th Brinstar Valkyries, a scion company of brigands and mercenaries, was deployed to raid a Chaos promethium factory. The airborne company faced thick snow, heavy air defenses, and a large enemy force across the region. In just a few days, the scions trekked nearly 50km through the snow and mountains, striking a variety of targets, including two airfields, crippling the local heretic air wings. Finally, they reached their target, and, along with simultaneous strikes against nearby air defenses, successfully destroyed the factory. This raid is certain to aid Imperial troops in the sector, now that the heretics have lost a vital source of fuel.

</br></br>CRUSADE LAUNCHES FOR AST’IR: SECTOR NOBILITY COMMIT TO FULL INDUSTRIAL RECLAMATION

</br></br>The sector nobility of Moread now stand at the precipice of salvation—or annihilation.

</br></br>Since the dark bloom of the Great Rift, nearly two decades prior, the sector’s economy has been carved hollow by warp storms, failed shipments, and endless insurrection. Mineral production has plummeted. Penal colonies vanish without trace. Naval pickets turn pirate or are swallowed whole in the immaterium.

</br></br>Amid this maelstrom of decay, the nobility have found a singular solution: conquest.

</br></br>Their chosen target lies on the ragged edge of the Damocles Gulf, nestled in a minor system once charted by man, but now defiled by xenos presence. The planet, known to the T’au as Ast’ir, is a former mining world whose mineral veins could supply no fewer than four hive cities for the next two centuries. Its current alien inhabitants, if not eradicated, could serve only as another insult to the Emperor’s legacy.

</br></br>A crusade has been declared.

</br></br>The Crusade Fleet, led by Lord Militant Sebastian Reginald Warsolt, is now assembled and has entered final staging near Port Mendax. Flanked by seventeen Militarum regiments and supported by the dreaded Gold Company of the Sternknecht Astartes, Warsolt’s aim is clear: the total reconquest of Ast’ir and the elimination of all resistance.

</br></br>As of this broadcast, Imperial augur arrays confirm that the Crusade Fleet has entered the system’s outer marker. Within days—if not hours—orbital bombardment will commence, and the defenders of Ast’ir will face annihilation from above and below.

</br></br>How long can such a fragile Kavaal hold?

</br></br>Will ancient grudges and hidden ambitions shatter the resistance from within?

</br></br>Will Ast’ir become a martyr, or the seed of rebellion?

</br></br>We will continue to follow the story from the front once the first shots are fired.

</br></br>Emperor protect.

<p class="magazine">Missed Connection at the Hive Z-97 Slum Mutant Burning
</br></br>You were the tall woman, wearing a blue flak-weave dress that made your eyes sparkle like a promethium fire. I was the purple guy with three arms, close to the top of the pyre.
</br></br>You set my heart ablaze, just like you did my clothes, my hair, and my cousin. 
</br></br>I want to dance with you: swing me around like you did your heavy flamer!
</br></br>If you feel the same, I'll be at next weeks immolation.
<p class="magazine">A recent audit of the Administratum's Form Repository found Form 42-A, a document used to request Form 42-A, to be "perfectly and gloriously redundant." A celebratory sermon was held to praise this achievement in bureaucratic completeness.
<p class="magazine">A Magos of the Adeptus Mechanicus, after several days of diagnostics, declared a faulty cogitator possessed by the "Spirit of Mediocrity." The machine was subsequently condemned and its data core was ritually purged to prevent the spread of its underwhelming influence.
<p class="magazine">Enforcers in Sector 7-Delta issued a number of fines to citizens after a group was found to be in violation of the "Public Decorum Act." Officials cited "inappropriate and excessive levels of public joy" as the offense, reminding the populace that such displays are reserved for sanctioned religious holidays.
