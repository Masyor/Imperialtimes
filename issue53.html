<h2 class="title--large main-title">EXCRUCIA HOLDS</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: mourhurst</em>
</br></br>By order of the Departmento Munitorum, preliminary casualty estimates from the opening engagements of the Ork WAAAGH against Excrucia have been released to the public, affirming both the scale of the conflict and the steadfast resolve of the Emperor’s defenders. Excrucia, a hive world stands as the foremost bastion between the greenskin menace and the heart of the Segmentum Tempestus.

</br></br>REPORTED LOSSES — FIRST 18 STANDARD HOURS

</br></br>Figures remain subject to revision as data from active war zones continues to arrive.

</br></br>IMPERIAL NAVY LOSSES
</br>—Tonnage Destroyed: ≈ 46,700 megatonnes
</br>—KIA: ≈ 1.4 billion
</br>—WIA: ≈ 600 million

</br></br>IMPERIAL GUARD LOSSES
</br>—KIA: ≈ 7.9 billion
</br>—WIA: ≈ 11.3 billion

</br></br>EXCRUCIA PLANETARY DEFENSE FORCE LOSSES
</br>—KIA: ≈ 5.2 billion
</br>—WIA: ≈ 8.6 billion

</br></br>CIVILIAN LOSSES
</br>—Evacuation failures and initial Ork landings: Est. 18–25 billion
</br>—Final numbers unknown and expected to rise

</br></br>STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

</br></br>Despite unprecedented losses, Imperial High Command reports that all primary hives on the Terratium Plate remain in Imperial hands. On the Ultimatium Plate, Hive Mortanis continues to resist under joint Astartes and Imperial Guard command but is reported to be the last Imperial bastion on said plate as the neighboring Hives have been overwhelmed by the Greenskin tide. Multiple Ork Rok landings were neutralized or delayed through decisive orbital and ground based countermeasures, resulting in catastrophic enemy losses estimated in the tens of billions, preventing more Orks from making landfall than initially expected. Total numbers of the WAAAGH are not yet known. The Segmentum Tempestus Navy, despite such losses continues to battle the Orks for supremacy over the planet and His Holy Majesty’s Imperial Guard and Angels of Death hold steadfast against the xeno attempt.

</br></br>The Emperor protects.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">NAVY PERSONEL INJURED AFTER RUN-IN WITH UNIDENTIFIED XENOS</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: _coati_</em>
</br></br>A run-in with unidentified Xenos while patrolling the Great Rift left several ships in shambles after attacking a Navy patrol. 'The attack was without warning, and without precedent,' says Commodore Aveton. 'The Xenos threat is still at large, and may attack again.'

</br></br>In filed reports from several surviving senior officers, the threat was described as various large, sentient, ship sized creatures resembling ancient Terran Krakens. Upon contact, they were initially presumed asteroids, until scanners picked up unusual readings. After reporting the find to command staff, they soon found the vile creatures approaching their vessels.

</br></br>When the first vessel was reached, the creatures grappled around the ship with their large appendages, slowly destroying it in a crushing grip. The Navy patrol was able to fend then off with the valiant sacrifice of several ships, including an up and coming Commander Harrison.

</br></br>Ecclesiarchy staff aboard have claimed it Chaos work, stating it was 'Fouler than even the likes of Xenos. It could only be the Archenemy at work.' The effort to provide proper cleansing rites has already been started.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">SIVIGEAN GENERAL TRIED FOR TECH-HERESY</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: _coati_</em>
</br></br>The Sivigean General Dagon Italus served faithfully alongside other Imperial forces during several campaigns for longer than a Century, including contributing majorly to the Hassian Campaign against the Tyrranid forces invading the Hassian system.

</br></br>During a recent campaign against Tyrranid forces, General Italus was found to be encouraging his forces to partake in the sin of modification. Supposedly, his forces were asked to have their vehicles nearly altered in an unsactioned manner, in an attempt to pull stuck vehicles from the muddy bogs of the invaded world.

</br></br>Thanks to the protest of a group of Enginseers overseeing the companies maintenance rituals and mechanical health, these grievous mistake was avoided, although only through great effort. Supposedly, General Italus berated the Tech-Priests for intervening, and continued ordering his men to make the modifications. After the incident, he is being tried by a local Arbites Judge. Local broadcasts state he is likely to be demoted to command of Penal companies, although Mechanicus vow to have him removed from service, threatening retaliation.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">KHARON-BETA, ONCE A PROUD INDUSTRIAL BASTION OF THE IMPERIUM, HAS FALLEN SILENT</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: _coati_</em>
</br></br>In what officials of the Administratum are calling “a total strategic loss and mass extinction event,” the planet Kharon-Beta was declared lost at 0426 standard Segmentum time after final vox contact with the planetary command ceased. 

</br></br>The world’s last coherent astropathic transmission, fragmented by empyric interference, contained just three words:

</br></br>“The tomb opens.”

</br></br>Astropathic message logs show that all Imperial defences went dark within six hours from first contact — an interval our representative from the Ordo Xenos states is “wholly consistent with mass Necron awakening protocols.”

</br></br>May the fallen heroes of Kharon-Beta find peace in the God-Emperor’s golden embrace, and may He protect us who remain against this vile Xeno threat.

      <h5>Administratum Updates</h5>
<p class="magazine"><strong>ATTACK MOON SPOTTED</strong>
  
  </br></br>Within Segementum obscuris Sector Calbalia an Ork Attack Moon has been rumoured to be spotted. Adminstatum and Terra would remind all imperial citizens that Orkoids and such xenos are incapable of creating such advanced technolgical feats. These are simply rumours and disruption by the enemies of the Emperor and his Imperium. Spreading such rumours and falsehoods will result in corporeal punishment repeated offenders will be subjected to servitorization. The Loss of Communication of the Pentagon worlds of Maria X are not the result of any Attack Moon but rather a Astrophathic complications originating from the Cicatrix Maledictum.


<p class="magazine"><strong>HEIR OF KNIGHT HOUSE FOUND</strong>
  
  </br></br>An heir of Knight House Philos has been found. 20 standard terran years ago, House de Philos was lost in the tyranid attack on the Eridian sector. The noble knights fought to their last, covering the retreat of civilians and inflicting heavy casualties to the Great Devourer, yet were ultimately felled by it.

  </br></br>Now the last surviving heir seems to have been unearthed by still loyal retainers of the House. Born the bastard to a commoner mother, he was hidden away on a far away planet. Unfortunately the revival of House de Philos remains a far away dream, as the heir has not been trained in the ways of the Questoris Imperialis and therefore not been given the Knightly Title of Aspirant. Without the support of a full-fledged and qualified Knight to bestow this title upon him, the heir apparent will not be allowed to bond with a Helm Mechanicum, yet alone a Throne Mechanicum.
