    <h2 class="title--large main-title">IMPERIAL TIMES DELAYED! HERETIC SABOTAGE SUSPECTED IN PRINTING DISRUPTIONS!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: The Editor</em>
</br></br>Loyal citizens of the Imperium are advised that this edition of The Imperial Times, typically delivered with the unflinching punctuality of an Imperial Guard regimental parade, has suffered an unprecedented delay. Initial investigations by the News-Enforcers point firmly towards insidious acts of heretic interference, specifically targeting the sacred processes of information dissemination.

</br></br>"Such a delay is an affront to the Emperor's Light and a clear sign that the perfidious forces of the Archenemy seek to blind His loyal servants," stated Chief Censor-Adept Thulian Vance, his brow furrowed with righteous indignation. "We suspect their foul machinations caused disruptions at various stages, from cogitator-scriptorium processing to the very servitor-delivery routes themselves. Rest assured, every pict-capture of every servitor on every route is being scrutinized for signs of aberrant behaviour."

</br></br>Indeed, reports from the Primary News-Forge show evidence of temporal flux anomalies and minor, yet irritating, ink-jet misalignment; all classic hallmarks of warp-tainted sabotage. Even the blessed paper reams themselves seemed reluctant to advance through the rollers. Such petty, yet vexing, acts of sabotage are precisely what the Heretic seeks: not open war, but the slow, grinding erosion of Imperial efficiency and morale.

</br></br>Furthermore, it has come to the attention of this very publication's oversight committee that the preceding draft of this very article‚Äîpenned with the foresight only the Emperor's blessed can possess‚Äîprophetically detailed the potential for such distribution anomalies. While the initial draft of this piece was intended as a hypothetical warning, a pre-emptive denouncement of potential Heretical acts, it has now, tragically, become a very real and present explanation for this tardy arrival. The irony is not lost on us. In fact, it's rather infuriating.

</br></br>"It seems the Archenemy knew we were onto them!" exclaimed a distraught News-Adept, who wished to remain anonymous, citing fear of 'retrospective temporal paradox-related re-education.' "They saw our foresight, our dedication to pre-emptively informing the populace, and reacted directly to it! A clear sign of their desperate, unoriginal tactics!"

</br></br>Rest assured, loyal readers, the delay has been rectified through the tireless efforts of devout Administratum thralls and excessively armed Arbites patrols. Further delays of this nature will not be tolerated, and any individual, servitor, or cogitator found to be complicit in this heretical disruption will face immediate and decisive Imperial Justice.

</br></br>We apologize for any inconvenience caused and remind all citizens that vigilance against the insidious whispers and minor bureaucratic snafus of Chaos is the eternal duty of all.

</br></br>FOR THE EMPEROR! AND FOR TIMELY NEWS!

</br></br>SKYFIRE OVER VORAX: THE ELYSIAN 122ND MAKES THE IMPOSSIBLE DROP

</br></br>SECTOR GAMMA-9, VORAX PRIME ‚Äì The skies burned, the winds screamed, and the void above was alive with flak and fire. Into this maelstrom dove the 122nd Elysian Drop Trooper Regiment, and through their fury, Imperial victory was carved.

</br></br>Their mission: seize and disable a heretic macro-cannon complex hammering orbital landers and reinforcement routes.
</br>Their challenge: survive the descent.
</br>Their answer: Jump. Burn. Kill. Repeat.

</br></br>---

</br></br>‚òÑÔ∏è ‚ÄúTHE SKY IS OURS‚Äù ‚òÑÔ∏è

</br></br>Deploying from Valkyrie gunships and grav-chutes, the 122nd performed a low-altitude combat drop directly into the teeth of Chaos anti-air batteries, scattering into kill-teams mid-descent. Most Imperial commanders would have called the operation suicide.

</br></br>Major Kiera Dorne, commanding officer of the 122nd, disagreed:
</br>‚ÄúWe're Elysians. If we aren't falling out of the sky into hell, we're not doing our jobs.‚Äù

</br></br>Within thirty-five minutes, the drop zone was secured. Within two hours, the macro-cannon was reduced to scrap and heretic corpses.


</br></br>---

</br></br>üî• BURNING FAST, HITTING HARD üî•

</br></br>Against the backdrop of burning manufactorums and the thunder of Baneblades in the east, the 122nd struck fast, blowing through traitor lines with melta charges, las-carbines, and lethal precision.

</br></br>Fighting without armor support and cut off from resupply, the drop troopers held the gun battery complex against three separate counterattacks from Chaos infantry and daemonspawn. Ammunition ran low. Wounds mounted. Still, they held.

</br></br>One vox-caster captured a snippet from Trooper Halric, relayed moments before a successful final charge:

</br>‚ÄúTell Command the macro-cannon‚Äôs offline. If we don‚Äôt make it back... we still landed closer than the Navy ever does.‚Äù

</br></br>---

</br></br>üõ°Ô∏è VICTORY IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH

</br></br>Casualties were severe. Of the original 3,000 Elysians who made the drop, only 1,128 were recovered for redeployment. Their sacrifice, however, broke the Chaos siege line on Grid Gamma-9, allowing Imperial landers to secure the front and pave the way for the 112th Armoured and 78th Mechanized to push forward.

</br></br>The skies over Vorax now belong to the Emperor again.
</br>Because the 122nd took them back.

</br></br>---

</br></br>üèÖ HONORS TO THE FALLEN, PRAISE TO THE LIVING

</br></br>The Order of the Winged Flame has been awarded to the regiment in full, along with 126 individual honors, including:

</br>The Macharian Drop Cross

</br>Valor Wings, Gold Device

</br>Posthumous promotion of Major Dorne to Colonel


</br></br>A new regimental motto has been officially logged in the Munitorum archives:

</br>‚ÄúSteel holds the line. We bring the sky down.‚Äù


</br></br>---

</br></br>**Let it be known: when the Emperor needs warriors to fall from the heavens, He calls the Elysians.
</br>And they always fall fast.**

<h2 class="title--large main-title with-border">STRANGE XENOS ON IN THE ULTAMA SECTOR</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: altonascends</em>
</br></br>Often it is a question of the wise and learned how to best hate something that you don't know. It is easy for the good imperial citizen to hate the T'au, there is so much to hate that it is almost impossible not to. From their disgusting lack of a nose to the inhuman color or their skin, to their stunted and malformed figure. The issue however comes when the xenos is lesser known to the imperial scholar then how to hate them. Well we here at the Jimmy Falcon news room has come up with a few simple tricks that will get you hating the xeno with the skill and regularity of a Sister of Battle. 

</br></br>Hate them for wasting your time. You as a good imperial citizen are diligent in your work and you don't have a lot of free time. How dare those xenos waste your precious time by making you think of new ways to hate them

</br></br>Hate them for being unknown. Our glorious imperium is unignorable, we clad ourselves in gold and fire so that our foes might not say that they were unready, for what is the point of utter superiority if you do not crush your opponent when he is at his strongest. As such how dare the perfidious xeno cloak themselves in shadow to strike when we are not ready, it is not only underhanded and pitiful to try and strike us, but more so to fail and be caught by our ever-vigilant guard.

</br></br>Hate them for being creepy.  All xenos are creepy as a matter of form, so hating them for being creepy is always a safe bet.

</br></br>Hate them for not having a news anchor half as good as yours truely Jimmy Falcon, signing off.
