    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: altonascends</em>
</br></br>I Brother Marin do upon the Throne of The Emperor and His Most Holy Sons do swear to the accuracy of the following testament. 

</br></br>I came to know of this war for the soul of cascadia when, my Lord, the Baron Allain did send for me from my monastery and having done such said to me the following. “It is often that the grand forces of the imperium are marshaled in great contests for the soul of worlds. It is within these actions that often great heroes are made of common folk and the true legends are forged. 

</br></br>So common are these actions however that the great hero’s and villains are forgotten, I will not have the heroes I shall embark upon this great contest forgotten when I die. You shall prevent this through your talents and I shall pay you handsomely”. I of course was flattered, at no point did i think that my humble writings had reached my Lordships ear and yet here I stood, but I could not sacrifice my soul for the chance to chronicle some grand story and so with some great form of trepidation I did ask the following “My lord it is with great sorrow I must decline, for you would wish of myself to record things in manners of which they did not happen and in doing so would consigned the men you served with to being naught but aberrations of themselves, not a soul would believe it.” 

</br></br>Upon this the Lord ruminated and did spend a minute in contemplation upon the subject, oft muttering of things like if I could be entrusted with certain knowledge, it is was with great solemnity that he did decree I could write this account with neither exaggeration or censor, but that certain things would have to be removed, that their were things better for man to not know lest they attempt to embark upon the same folly as their foes. It was with these terms that I was commissioned to enshrine this tale in lore. 

</br></br>It was with grim determination that the Orphaned angels of Caliban did go about their acts. That they did in their accounting found that the Ciuedad de Portuaria accounting had come due, and that in their actions had so offended the LORD as to have no other means of recoures. It is in such action that those Orphaned Angels so far from home did raise their lance, and having done so struck the Ciuedad de Portuaria  and in doing so released a great flood upon that fell land, their was much destruction and a great potion of the cities mighty river was turned to ash in the cups of those few who survived. Of those who survived the angels did draw blade and descending from the heavens did take to smiting the foe in their thousands.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">REBELS ROUTED, OFFICERS HONORED, ARMAGEDDON ARMOR ASSEMBLED</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: beardog2150</em>
</br></br>In the aftermath of the successful Imperial campaign against rebels threatening to seize the vital agri-world of Merovan III, honors and accolades have been justly delivered to those righteous defenders of the Imperium of Man who fought so valiantly.  Among those so rewarded are Major General Alois Graugarten, former Colonel of the 68th Armageddon Steel Legion.  Having demonstrated his worthiness to direct the soldiers of the Emperor, Major General Graugarten's responsibilities have been expanded to include the 345th Armageddon Armored Regiment, currently undergoing outfitting on a top secret Imperial marshaling world.

</br></br>We were able to interview Colonel Lutz Tanneberger of the 345th, and he made this statement: 'Serving the Emperor in the Imperial Guard is the greatest honor and duty I can imagine; I can conceive of no better life, and no other life, for myself.  My regiment may be new, but I have every confidence in my men, in myself, and in Major General Graugarten.  We will fight for the Emperor, and no enemy shall stand against us.'  Inspiring words from Colonel Tanneberger!  May the blessings of the Emperor rain down upon His Imperium and upon the fighting men and women of Armageddon!
