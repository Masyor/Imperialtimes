Issue 7452.M42 – Internal Distribution Only</br>
WORLD: Vortan’s Reach </br>
SECTOR: Obscurus </br>
CLASSIFICATION: Sub-Confidential – Eyes of the Administratum Only 

</br></br>Cascadian and Kavskyans soon greeted each other with open arms and humility. Quickly the commander of the defense of the island of Ariadora and Lord General Karanov meet and discuss plans to push the dangerous traitors and vile xenos off the island.

</br></br>Reports from the lower districts of Vortan’s Reach have begun circulating of a strange, violent encounter beneath Hive-Sublevel Theta-9. Official statements describe a brief “containment operation” against heretic elements, but witness testimonies suggest something far more mysterious. Several survivors speak of towering, silver-armored warriors—figures that moved with supernatural speed, their helms shaped like visors from ancient Terran myths. They wielded weapons of crackling energy and blazing swords, and bore no insignia of any known Imperial formation. Medicae logs detected unexplained psychic disturbances, and vox-recorders across the sector failed simultaneously as the figures appeared. Attempts to retrieve surveillance footage were unsuccessful—data slates wiped, cogitator banks fried. A coincidence, say some. Others aren’t so sure. The strange anomalies coincide with the presence of an unmarked voidship seen in orbit for just under 20 minutes before vanishing without registration or clearance. Strat-seers noted atmospheric distortion and warp residue too subtle to be coincidence. Adding to the mystery, multiple records across Administratum and Medicae halls were suddenly sealed. Several civilian witnesses have been reassigned or are now missing. Others have returned… altered. Silent. Minds vacant of recent memory. The term whispered in underground vox-channels is one most dare not speak aloud: Grey Knights. A name more myth than fact. Said to be the Emperor’s hidden blade, a Chapter of psychic warriors forged not for conquest, but for purging daemonic taint with total, unrelenting finality. Worlds touched by their presence are often erased from record. Survivors, if any, rarely speak. If such beings truly descended upon Vortan’s Reach, it raises a chilling question: What did they come to destroy? And more importantly… Was it truly destroyed?

    <h2 class="title--large main-title with-border">  WAR MACHINE RETAKEN FROM VILE HERETICS</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: argo_1278</em>
</br></br>Good news comes to us from the Sabbat Sector! Guardsmen fighting to reclaim the industrial world of Dantres Rift have been engaged in purging the heretics of the Blood Pact that taint the world. Among them is a Baneblade, deployed to attempt to push the Guardsmen of the 88th Maharlikan Bravos, 1st Venadian Rangers, and 1028th Cadian Shock Troopers out of the city of Karvivi. Blasphemed by heretical symbols and press-ganged into offensive operations, the Baneblade begged to be properly returned to the Imperium and the light of the Omnissiah! Thanks to the tenacity, grit, and cunning of the three regiments present, the Baneblade was lured into the city and pried free of the Heretics' grasp, ready to serve the Imperium once more!

</br></br>In commemoration of this event, the Baneblade has been rechristened The Spirit of Camaraderie in honor of its recovery.
