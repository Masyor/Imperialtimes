    <h2 class="title--large main-title"> IN REMEMBRANCE OF A SAINT</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: paladintakezo</em>
</br></br> On today, the most solemnest of days, a day so gut-wrenching, so heart-rending, we must once again call to mind the anniversary of the death of Saint Rykus Prex, devout Cardinal of Aquiline IV and his martyrdom at the hands of savage and despicable xenos invaders. 
    
</br></br>It has been an entire century since his harrowing sacrifice, and not once in those one hundred years have we forgiven the vile fiends that stole the beloved Saint Prex from us! 

</br></br>To commemorate the anniversary and celebrate the life of her most esteemed mentor, Cardinal Scarassa II, Aquiline IV's current most Holiest of Cardinals, will be present in the City of Honored Dead, unveiling the newest addition to Saint Prex's Mausoluem: a 200 meter tall monument of the Martyred Saint wreaking vengeance upon his xenos killers and smiting them down with his firey staff! 

</br></br>Join her in honoring Saint Prex, and make sure to bring plenty of alms and donations for the Temple!

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">THE JARL RETURNS</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: harrydugg</em>
</br></br>The drums of war beat, their thunder echoing across the void as a long-exiled son prepares to return.

</br></br>Jarl Harald of House Kaldrith, once a Freeblade wandering the stars, now a lord in his own right, gathers his allies for the coming war. Eight years ago, the vital world of Kaldrith—renowned for its proud knightly traditions and rich mineral deposits—fell into darkness. Betrayed from within, it was seized by the corrupted scions of The Black Tundra, who pledged their oaths to Chaos. The invasion was swift and merciless; the defenders of Kaldrith fought with desperate valor, but the planet’s bastions were broken, its proud hosts slaughtered, and its ruling monarch of House Aurora cut down beside the house’s sacred Crown-Knight.

</br></br>What remained of Kaldrith became a ruin, a world of ash and despair where noble ice was trampled under the hooves of traitors.

</br></br>Yet exile has forged Harald into more than the dispossessed heir of a fallen House. For nearly a decade he has walked the path of a Freeblade, waging war wherever the Emperor’s enemies might be found. In that time, he has won renown for his fury in battle and his indomitable spirit. He has earned the trust of Astartes Chapters, formed bonds with allied Knight Houses, and gathered a following of warriors who share his unbending hatred for traitors.

</br></br>Now, with banners raised and a great warfleet mustering, Harald returns—not as a lone knight errant, but as a Jarl commanding hosts. His vow is clear: Kaldrith will be purged of the blight that festers upon it. The traitorous Black Tundra will be cast down, their heresy repaid in blood and fire.

</br></br>Reports from his council speak of Knight lances and Astartes strike cruisers assembling at rally points across the sector, banners of disparate houses flying together under Harald’s banner. The oaths have been spoken. The blades have been sharpened. The crusade for Kaldrith’s liberation has begun.

</br></br>The drums of war beat louder now, calling all loyal sons and daughters of the Imperium to witness the reckoning.

</br></br>The Jarl returns.

<h2 class="title--large main-title"> THE SPIRIT, THE FAITH, AND THE FIGHT!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: tidus1307</em>
</br></br> Ladies and gentlemen, you won’t believe the daring tale sweeping through the stars tonight! After a dastardly attack by those midnight marauders, the treacherous Night Lords, against our holy shrine world of Ophelia VII our own brave and faithful warriors of the Adepta Sororitas, shoulder to shoulder with the indomitable Black Templars, leapt into pursuit through the void itself!

</br></br> But hold onto your hats, folks, because the villains were caught red-handed, locked in savage combat with none other than a xenos Craftworld of the Eldar! Audacious? Absolutely. Suicidal? You bet your bottom Throne Gelt! Their pride, ladies and gentlemen, will be the very rope that hangs them!

</br></br> Now here’s the headline act: the flagship of the Argent Shroud, *The Holy Light*, came barreling into the fray, delivering wave after wave of the Emperor’s most loyal warriors onto that alien soil. The cost? Dire. Worth it? Absolutely. Reports confirm the Night Lords made off with a priceless relic holy to the Master of Mankind Himself, once held by a most hallowed Saint! With such a treasure at stake, there was no time for second-guessing. The Holy Light thundered through the enemy blockade like a charging grox, breaking the line wide open and securing the drop of Imperial reinforcements!

</br></br> But fate was cruel, dear readers. In its final, blazing sacrifice, The Holy Light plunged into the Craftworld, collapsing alien spires, sundering architecture, and sending uncounted xenos screaming into the void. A tragedy, yes, but one sung already as holy martyrdom!

</br></br> And so the war rages on! Countless Imperials stride the alien halls of the Craftworld itself, locked in bloody struggle to seize back the relic most sacred! The fight is fierce, the hour is late, but make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen; Faith will see the Emperor’s light shine once again!
