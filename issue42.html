    <h2 class="title--large main-title">GOONING RISES ON THE WORLD OF FANUM DUE TO TAX</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: altonascends</em>
</br></br>Gooning, the act of joing an underhive gang as loyal, if slightly dull, muscle. The act has become a highly lucrative as due to the new “Fanum Tax” (tax on the world of Fanum) levied by the Governor to fund his continual feast that has been going on for over 600 years. 
</br></br>This has been a highly tense thing and has nearly bankrupted the world multiple times, the new tax should have paid for the feast for nearly another 50 years. However due to specific wording on the tax the act of the temporarily working as manual labor is not considered a taxable issue. 
</br></br>This should not have been an issue as there is nowhere on world to do so, or so it was thought. However it turns out the local underhive gangs have in fact been low on manpower since the Great Underhive war lead to such a great amount of casualties that a local Arbite described it as “Those Drokkers doing out job for us”.  
</br></br>How this will change the face of the world remains to be seen, however our informant in the Local Arbites has stated that they are preparing to undertake multiple high casualty operations, well high casualties for the foes of the God Emperor that is. It remains to be seen if gooning is a fad or if gooning is here to stay. 
</br></br>Keeping you up to date on the Fanum Tax and its effects are to be seen. 
</br></br>This is Jimmy Falcon signing off of the imperial times.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">VICTORY IN WIEDEN</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: amarain12</em>
</br></br>For the last six months, the holy city of Wieden has been under siege by heretic forces. The vile heretics numbers in the tens of thousands, even bringing titans to siege the city. Inside the walls of the city, the brave defenders numbered only 6,000. Following a bold move, the Maharlikan Expeditionary Brigade was deployed inside the city, while forces from the Astra Militarum, Legio Titanicus, Adeptus Astartes, and Tempestus Scions advanced from the mountains north of the city in an attempt to break the siege.

</br></br>The enemy was woefully unprepared for the overwhelming might of the Imperium, with the reinforcements smashing their way through multiple defensive lines. As they fought their way south, the Maharlikans and PDF repelled two major attacks, even after the enemy detonated massive mines below the walls. Finally, just as the relief force entered sight of Wieden, a portal opened in the center of Wieden, releasing hordes of heretics into the holy streets. Not to be defeated when victory in sight, the defenders rushed into the fray, inflicting massive casualties on the enemy. At the crucial moment, the relief force entered the city, helping crush the remaining heretics, following the portals closure. The triumphant men of the Imperium are wrapping up operations, and preparing for their next deployment.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">THE BLOODY DANTRES RIFT, A WAR LONG IN THE MAKING</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: warclaimer</em>
</br></br>It has been roughly a year since the bloody heretic cleansing campaigns on the Sabbat world of Dantres Rift and already the conflict has escalated. Where in the initial campaign traitor and heretic guard forces along with reported sightings of Heretic Astartes, a campaign courageously fought by both our courageous Guard and Mechanicus forces and several elite ones in the form of the Adeptus Astartes and the Adeptus Astra Telepathica just to name a few.

</br></br>In the year since the formal declaration of the conflict the situation has gone from bad to worse. The Heretic forces entrenched themselves as rain pelts the land, reported sightings of Heretic Astartes have grown since the last campaign, to top it off the enemy have deployed an enemy Titan Legio. Despite the circumstances and bleak outlook all is not lost yet, a call has been put out and now a force begins to form, some veterans of the first campaign and others fresh to this area of conflict but no doubt seasoned in some way shape or form.

</br></br>In the eyes of this writer there is no doubt that the campaign will be won decisively by our brave forces on the front, the only thing we need to worry about as bystanders to the conflict is giving our most devout of prayers for their triumph against the foul forces of the Archenemy.

<h2 class="title--large main-title">CLIMENES: THE JEWEL OF THE FRONTIER.</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: sigmar13</em>
</br></br>From the Realm of Ultramar, Astartes consolidated a base in the system of Climenes.
</br></br>From the Dead World of Alistran, new people, industry, and technology have arrived.
</br></br>But most importantly: The Sector consolidated its power, breaking away from at least 3 other Sectors, after around 5 years of negotiation, and succeeded in returning to its old borders, from the Age of the Great Crusade.

</br></br>The new Sector Lord, Esteban Saravia, has dedicated his life to service in the Imperium, and has been aptly rewarded. But in a shock to many Planetary Governors, he hasn't taken full control of several planets, giving it to Kin, instead, He has formed a council of around 12 Members to lead, himself included.
</br></br>There is word that some other units of the Imperium will join in groups, organisations, if you will, to handle every aspect of Imperial Life. For the betterment of the citizenry, but so far, the only news on that front is the reforged Trade Routes, as masses of goods flood the markets nearby. 
</br></br>The planet of Nueva Alistran has been chosen as the Sector Capital, and its vast armouries have been opened to any leader that might want to Import their weaponry. The Sector has been noted as an industrious one, and, even if not a Literal Jewel, one could say the real jewel is the Manufactorums, the Sector Members, and the vast amount of potential this endeavour has.

<h2 class="title--large main-title"> MYSTERIOUS MIRACLES</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: harrydugg</em>
</br></br>Reports from several sectors confirm an unprecedented rise in holy miracles. Entire battalions have witnessed sudden healings, the unnatural strengthening of loyal Imperial citizens, and the smiting of vile heretical foes by what can only be described as the divine hand of the God-Emperor Himself.

</br></br>A recent vox transmission from the Segmentum Solar recounts a Guardsman stricken with mortal wounds rising anew to fight on, bellowing the Emperor’s name as the heretics before him were struck down by righteous fire. In the Eastern Fringe, entire shrines have been bathed in radiant light, and scores of the faithful have sworn oaths of miraculous visions of the Emperor’s golden visage.

</br></br>Authorities of the Ecclesiarchy confirm: this is undeniable proof of the Emperor’s divine will manifesting ever more strongly through His most loyal subjects. These miracles are the Emperor’s blessing in our darkest times, a beacon for the faithful and a scourge upon His enemies.

</br></br>Be vigilant, however, citizens of the Imperium. Do not heed heretical whispers that these powers carry some darker origin, or that misfortune follows those who wield them. Such lies are the poison of the unfaithful, spread by those who would turn your gaze from the Emperor’s light. To speak them is heresy. To believe them is treachery.

</br></br>The Emperor protects.

<h2 class="title--large main-title">TRAGEDY STRIKES OVER GOSSIP</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: someguui </br>(modified by the editor)</em>
</br></br>In a shocking development, Imperial Times Junior Scrivener Alessa Kryll was discovered deceased in her small hab-apartment early this morning, a tragic victim of a suspected heretical incursion. The Precinct-Auditors who made the discovery reported a scene of violent struggle, with all signs pointing to a sudden and brutal ambush. Of particular concern, however, was what they found on her personal scribe-slate.

</br></br>The half-finished article on the scribe-slate contained an insane and blasphemous diatribe, riddled with unspeakable and treasonous lies about the highest echelons of Imperial power. While the vast majority of the text was immediately purged and declared a Class-4 Heresy, the investigating officials released a brief summary of its deranged contents to the public as a cautionary tale. It spoke of high lords engaged in "base gossip" and, most alarmingly, attempted to link the sacred name of the Lord Regent, Roboute Guilliman, with a foul xenos creature. Such utter madness is a clear sign of warp-tainted corruption.

</br></br>Chief Censor-Adept Thulian Vance, who oversaw the initial purge of the data, addressed a press conference, his face grim. "The insidious tendrils of Heresy seek to corrupt even the most mundane aspects of our lives. This poor scrivener, in her final moments, was clearly being tormented by the lies of the Archenemy. Her final, incomprehensible scrawl is a stark reminder that even a stray thought or a whispered rumor can be a gateway for corruption. We must remain vigilant."

</br></br>The Department of Inquisitorial Affairs has since been notified of the incident, and a full investigation is underway. All of the scrivener's associates and known contacts have been taken into custody for immediate psychological reconditioning. The paper trails of her recent projects are being scoured for any further signs of taint. The Imperial Times would like to extend its condolences to the family of the deceased and remind all loyal citizens that a stray rumor can lead to the damnation of one's soul.

<p class="magazine"><b>HAUNTED FORTRESS ON FREU!</b>
</br></br><em>From: thefelgus</em>
</br></br>Local PDF soldiers on the depot planet of Freu report sightings of a mysterious man dressed in the regalia of a general. Records state that General Upp, one of the base's previous commanders, had died during an industrial accident relating to the loading of crates of spare berets onto a ship. The ghost, now known as the Freu Up, is actively being hunted by guardsmen on base seeking the current General's reward of 6 extra ration slips and, as of last night, a shipment of lho sticks!

</br></br>We wish the guardsmen of Freu the best of luck on their hunt for the Freu Up!</p>
<p class="magazine"><b>REPENT! REPENT NOW, I TELL YOU, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!</b>
</br></br><em>From: paladintakezo</em>
</br></br>A cult has sprung up in the mean streets of the Zarkadan Underhive, a cult dedicated wholly to meting out the wrath and vindication of the Master of Mankind! They are the Priory of the Revving Blade, a band of one-armed, chainsword-wielding fanatics who would stop at nothing to strike down the mutant, the heretic, and the alien.

</br></br>Some say they were formed from a shift of dock workers that, in the process of fending off a group of raiders and bandits, cracked open an Astra Militarum-bound shipment of sharp-toothed chain blades and turned them against their would-be attackers.How exactly this act of simple self-defence blossomed into a full-scale Death Cult is unknown, but we here at the Imperial Times are working around the clock in an attempt to schedule an interview with one of their members!

</br></br>In the meantime, be on the lookout for the signs and symbology of the cult around you! Initiates into the cult are referred to as “Brothers,” and must amputate their own hand as a test of their faith and devotion to the God-Emperor. Above that is the “Honored Brother,” only differentiated by their arms being removed at the elbow. At the top of the Priory’s food-chain is the “Enlightened,” a mysterious sect of the Death Cult that has their entire arm removed! Beyond that, nothing else is known about these individuals referred to as the “Enlightened,” but they sure don’t sound like someone you’d want to meet late at night!</p>
