    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: muskovite</em>
</br></br>As the war on Cascadia continues drop troopers of the First Thalian Field Army came to rescue the the defenders of Ariadora Island. Which housed many powerful aquatic battleships of the Imperial Navy. In a grandiose combat drop, nearly fifteen thousand drop infantry of the 2nd Kavsky Air Assault Division landed. 

</br></br>Cascadian and Kavskyans soon greeted each other with open arms and humility. Quickly the commander of the defense of the island of Ariadora and Lord General Karanov meet and discuss plans to push the dangerous traitors and vile xenos off the island.

</br></br>The First Kavsky Corps is still embittered in heavy fighting to win the island once and for all. May the holy defenders of the Imperium grant island it's peace.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title with-border"> TRAITOROUS TROOPS WHO TREAT WITH TAU TAKEN TO TASK</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: altonascends</em>
</br></br>All men can fail. Something that each manufactorum overseer can tell you.  

</br></br>Sometimes how ever those failures can come from those who we rely upon to keep us and our prosperity safe from the tremendous xenos threat. Such an even occurred recently on the world of hundar recently as memebers of the Astra Milituarum committed the ultimate heresy of giving captured Tau soldiers double the standard amount of water. 

</br></br>This flagrant heresy was caught by yours truely reader as he was on the hunt for a good story and I did what any upstanding citizen should do. I found a Commisar. That’s right folks the moral becon of any Guard force is the commisar. Capable of debating philosophy with the best and then blow the head off an ork at a hundred paces with a pistol at the same time a Commisar those high flying products of the Schola Proginuim are who any good soldier should be honored to call Sir. 

</br></br>When informed of this vile act the clever commissar found a way to keep the effectiveness of the force without sacrificing the punishment. The offending soldiers were swiftly placed into the kindness of the penal program so these misguided sinners might have a chance to redeem their souls with the glory of martyrdom, albeit a little parched with their water ration having been slashed in half. They are prisoners after all.
