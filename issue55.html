<h2 class="title--large main-title">THE TITHE, THE TRUTH, AND THE TASTE OF ASH</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: Ian Danews</em>
</br></br>The rain on Selexius IV doesn’t just fall, it conspires. It’s a thick, marshy soup that clings to your coat like a bad reputation, and in this sector, reputations are the only thing cheaper than a life. I was there when the call went out, the kind of call that makes planetary governors sweat and high-stakes players fold their hands. The Imperial Tithe had been plucked right out of the void by forces unknown. The brass sent in the big guns: Lord Marshal Jovinus Steele, a man carved out of the Lex Imperialis. I was riding shotgun, the "wordsmith" tasked with making whatever mess we made along the way look good.

</br></br>We started in Kalk, a city that looks like a cathedral but smells like a sewer. We met Marshal Xalasar of the Arbites, a man who offered us a "weak lead" in the lawless gut of Quinx like he was handing us a bouquet of hemlock. He sent us to a nightclub called the Adeptus Amasec, claiming it was the only way to find the shuttles that had slipped through the swamp. But the "lead" was more like a leash. While Steele and I were wading through the muck, Xalasar was back in the capital playing bureaucratic shell games, burying documents in red tape to keep us from seeing the rot in his own backyard. We found a PDF armory along the way, nothing but corpses and the cold that kept them company. 

</br></br>The night took a turn for the surreal at the Amasec. I sat across from a dame named Valerie who knew my name before I’d even ordered a drink. She wasn't just another ghost in the city; she was [REDACTED]. The [REDACTED] had been holding the deck the whole time. Her boss offered us a deal: help him find his missing pieces in the marsh, and we’d get our pirates. It was the kind of deal you only make when you have a gun to your head and the Devil is holding the trigger.

</br></br>The trail led us off-world, into the cold embrace of the void where the pirate flagship, the Avarice, sat fat with stolen goods. It was a boarding action that’ll haunt my dreams for years. We punched through their hull like a drunk through a bar door. I watched Draven, a man who we all thought to be more resilliant than ceremite, charge a warp-witch with a shotgun and a prayer. One word from her, a whisper from the deep dark, and Draven was just… gone. No body to bury, just a red mist and silence. Lord Marshal Steele, ribs shattered like the dreams of so many gutter rats, didn't stop. He marched across that blood-slicked bridge and put the cuffs on Admiral Ulrik himself. The Law doesn't care if you're bleeding out, it just wants the record closed.

</br></br>The tithe is back: five massive cargo ships full of the materials that keep this sector breathing. The [REDACTED] got his prize, a [REDACTED] that’ll either be our salvation or the match that starts the fire. Admiral Ulrik is in a cage, and the Lord Marshal is in a med-bay. They call it a victory. But as I sit here in the flicker of a stim-shop sign, I’m thinking about Draven and the men we left in the mud of Selexius IV. The Empire got its share, but the price was paid in full by men whose names will never make the front page.

</br></br>In this galaxy, the truth is just a commodity. And today, the price was too damn high.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">FELIX SANGUINALA</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: .rayja</em>
</br></br>Dear jubilant viewers. As many of you no doubt know, this Solar week is none other then the week of Sanguinala, approaching soon for us here on Terra. Rivaling only the glorious feast of the Emperor's Ascension, I know many of you merry and pious viewers are hard at work preparing your worlds for the countless celebrations that will commemorate the noble sacrifice of the Flawless Angel, Son of The God-Emperor, and Holy Brother to our Reverent Lord Regent, Sanguinius. For us at the Imperial Times here on Holy Terra, we have been hard at work preparing for the upcoming festivities and pious processions to commence. 

</br></br>And while we would talk through our own perspective and jubilant excitement for such a divine date, we would like to dedicate this segment to some words and good-wishes from a familiar bishop regular readers will no doubt recognize from our 50th Indomitus Era issue anniversary.

</br></br>From Chael Kardranno of Shrine World Hellion V, Segmentum Solar, Bishop of the Cathedral of The Beneficent God-Emperor and His Holy Majesty's Adeptus Ministorum.

</br></br>"Viewers, both the young and old, high and low born, from the frontier and core worlds, I would like to wish you a very happy Sanguinala from The Adeptus Ministorum here on Hellion V and hopefully across our Holy Imperium of Man. I would also like to speak about the celebration, and the massive role it plays in our lives, even as short as the day comes and ends.

</br></br>Recently I spoke about this in my daily sermon, that very often, I have come across many a preacher and pious adherent who only see Sanguinala and in fact Sanguinius from the perspective of his sacrifice for The God-Emperor of Mankind and our divine Imperium. I would like to invite you viewers to consider more about the Flawless Angel, for even as he was without such petty failings that we find throughout our lives across the galaxy, he was still laid low by the Arch-Heretic. I would like to provide to you viewers a reminder that death shall always lay around the corner, for all of us, but that what matters is how we make our deaths, our struggles, our sacrifices meaningful. Not just to the God-Emperor, but your world, your community, your family, and yourself.

</br></br>I implore all who may be struggling with the darkness that plagues the waves of doubt and cynicism this season to remember Sanguinius, to remember that no matter who you are, death is no stranger to us, and that the lives that the God-Emperor grants to us are sacred for their power, to shake the very foundations of evil and to save countless trillions across our beleaguered Imperium.

</br></br>Enough of my grimness though. Enjoy whatever celebrations your world may bring about, no doubt they are all such wondrous and pious festivities I lament being able to attend. Felix Sanguinala, Ave Imperium, and remember viewer..."

</br></br>The Emperor Protects.

    <h2 class="title--large main-title">VICTORY IN THE SNOWFIELDS!</h2>
    <div class="main-text multi-column-3">
      <em>From: kelimnac</em>
</br></br>Good morrow, diligent and true citizens. News from the frontiers has finally reached the desk of this faithful, lowly reporter, sworn simply to convey it to you, reader.

</br></br>A recently formed regiment of the Imperium's finest, the Astra Militarum, has finally left their homeworld to seek glory amongst the stars, with a fresh victory under their belts on the homefront.

</br></br>The 17th Bel Vor Mixed Infantry, a combined arms formation raised as an experiment authorized by the planetary government, had their first action as a force on their own world, defeating an off-season raid by treacherous Greenskin xenos.

</br></br>The leader of this Ork band, known as Da Little Stompa, was slain personally by the commander of the 17th, Colonel Maximillian Ashald, after tricking the Warboss into overextending his forces in an attack on the regiment's fortifications. Meanwhile, the Colonel's other forces destroyed an Ork stronghold on the hills surrounding the Crown, a giant mountain capping Bel Vor's northern pole.

</br></br>Having finished replenishing their losses and expanding the defensive line for local defense forces to hold against further attacks come summer, the 17th Bel Vor boarded their dropships and set off for their first off-world deployment.

</br></br>We were able to reach Colonel Ashald for comment during their transit, and he had the following to say:

</br></br>"Our victory on Bel Vor belongs to every one of the 17th, not mine alone. I can only be proud of my men for valiantly defending the backbone of the Imperium, its hardworking civilians. With our work done at home, we aim to send back word of further victories, and bring a sense of hope and satisfaction. But more importantly than that, the 17th aim to do our duty. That is all we can hope to do."

</br></br>The Times thanks Colonel Ashald for his inspiring words, and wish he and his troops in the Mixed Infantry great fortune in their battles to come.

<p class="magazine"><strong>FAMINE ON FOOTFALL, UPDATE #1</strong>
  
  </br></br>FELIX SANGUINALA, esteemed readers!

</br></br>Through the efforts of the Drusian subsect of the Ecclesiarchy, the riots on Footfall abated just in time to celebrate this most esteemed of holidays. We give thanks to these humble men and women of Saint Drusius, both for ending the chaos and for alleviating - at least to a minor extent - the ongoing food shortages on the waystation through generous donations from across the sector. 

</br></br>In related news, local admininstration have agreed to launch an inquiry, as well as put out a call to both the Imperial Navy and enterprising Rogue Traders to track down the ongoing source of the food shortages. 

</br></br>We shall keep you, esteemed viewers, updated as the situation unfolds!

<p class="magazine"><strong>ARPEGGIO BLUE ENGAGES IN TRADE WITH LEAGUES OF VOTANN</strong>
  
  </br></br>The Governor of the paradise world Arpeggio Blue hired a mercenary band of the abhuman Leagues of Votann. While the hiring and usage of abhumans is well, the Votann, who call themselves "Kin", are a special case. Adepts of the Administratum and Techpriests of the Adeptus Mechanicus are not yet sure, if the Votann are truly to be counted as an abhuman strain of the Emperor given form. There are some who say they are truly Xenos.

</br></br>The hiring of mercenary Votann is therefore ecclesiastical and legal grey area. Yet no opposition has formed on Arpeggio Blue. Governor Louis remains a loved and venerated personality by his subjects and guests of the paradise world.
